All that perfect MotionPlus movement has left us all biting our lips for this game’s release, without even thinking about all the mysteries that are already out since the beginning of last year.</p>\n<p>But what’s the fun about spinning the WiiMote to attack an enemy without really feeling the power of the Master Sword? Well, actually you’ll never be able to feel it, but at least, if you’re fan enough, you can buy the <a href=\"http://www.camyinternational.com/heropack/\" title=\"Hero Pack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hero Pack</a>, from <a href=\"http://www.camyinternational.com/\" title=\"Camy International\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Camy International</a> enterprise.</p>\n<p>This pack is not new, it was released in the beginning of 2007, when Wii was still a little baby, and a Zelda for Wii was just a dream. I don’t know why, but it seems this product didn’t get very famous, and nowadays it’s practically impossible to find it, but it had everything to work out well – With an IGN review and everything.</p>\n<p>Watch <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/videos/2007/08/07/camy-pro-hero-pack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">mini-video-review from IGN</a> about the pack for more information.</p>\n<p>After a long search, I finally found this item selling on an italian website, <a href=\"http://www.hardstore.com/\" title=\"HardStore.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">hardstore.com</a>, and for our joy, it ships to Brazil!! =D YAY</p>\n<p>The only problem is the price, it’s not very friendly, the product’s price is €13.00 + €25.00 shipping cost, which gives a total of around R$90,00, that without considering the possible custom taxes when it gets here.</p>\n<p>If you’re interested in, just access its page, <a href=\"http://www.hardstore.com/default.asp?cmd=getProd&#x26;cmdID=46422\" title=\"Haro Pack @ HardStore\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>clicking here</strong></a>. But take action quickly, on the website it says that the product will expire in July 28, and I don’t know if they’ll continue selling it after that date.</p>\n<p>I obviously already ordered mine, now I just have to wait, and when it gets here I’ll post some photos and videos here (since there is no other video of it on the internet).</p>\n<p>See below some more photos of it:</p>\n<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;

All that perfect MotionPlus movement has left us all biting our lips for this game's release, without even thinking about all the mysteries that are already out since the beginning of last year.\r\n\r\nBut what's the fun about spinning the WiiMote to attack an enemy without really feeling the power of the Master Sword? Well, actually you'll never be able to feel it, but at least, if you're fan enough, you can buy the [Hero Pack](http://www.camyinternational.com/heropack/ \"Hero Pack\"), from [Camy International](http://www.camyinternational.com/ \"Camy International\") enterprise.\r\n\r\nThis pack is not new, it was released in the beginning of 2007, when Wii was still a little baby, and a Zelda for Wii was just a dream. I don't know why, but it seems this product didn't get very famous, and nowadays it's practically impossible to find it, but it had everything to work out well – With an IGN review and everything.\r\n\r\nWatch [mini-video-review from IGN](https://www.ign.com/videos/2007/08/07/camy-pro-hero-pack) about the pack for more information.\r\n\r\nAfter a long search, I finally found this item selling on an italian website, [hardstore.com](http://www.hardstore.com/ \"HardStore.com\"), and for our joy, it ships to Brazil!! =D YAY\r\n\r\nThe only problem is the price, it's not very friendly, the product's price is €13.00 + €25.00 shipping cost, which gives a total of around R$90,00, that without considering the possible custom taxes when it gets here.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in, just access its page, [**clicking here**](http://www.hardstore.com/default.asp?cmd=getProd&cmdID=46422 \"Haro Pack @ HardStore\"). But take action quickly, on the website it says that the product will expire in July 28, and I don't know if they'll continue selling it after that date.\r\n\r\nI obviously already ordered mine, now I just have to wait, and when it gets here I'll post some photos and videos here (since there is no other video of it on the internet).\r\n\r\nSee below some more photos of it:\r\n\r\n![Hero Pack 2](../../uploads/blog/2010/02/hero_pack_2.jpg)\r\n\r\n![Hero Pack 3](../../uploads/blog/2010/02/hero_pack_3.jpg)\r\n","frontmatter":{"tags":["general","zelda","games","accessories","skyward sword","wii"],"categories":["games"],"allowComments":true,"publishOnMedium":false,"cover":"../../covers/2010/post-id-1826-cover.png","date":"2010-02-18T00:00:00.000Z","id":1826,"path":"camy-hero-pack-for-those-who-cannot-wait-for-the-new-zelda","show":true,"title":"Camy Hero Pack - For those who cannot wait for the next Zelda","hideExcerpt":false,"subtitle":""}},"next":{"excerpt":"Depois de muito tempo de espera, chegou minha guitarra pra…","html":"<p>Depois de muito tempo de espera, chegou minha guitarra pra Wii.
