This sparked my sense of wanderlust and desire to discover new places and cultures.</p>\n<p>As I grew older, I realized that the world was vast and full of opportunities, and I didn’t want to be confined to just one little town in Brazil. So, I made the decision to pursue my dream of living and working abroad. In this post, I will share my journey and how an open source project played a role in landing me a job abroad.</p>\n<h2 id=\"open-source-projects-and-hackathons\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#open-source-projects-and-hackathons\" aria-label=\"open source projects and hackathons permalink\" class=\"post-headers-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Open Source projects and hackathons</h2>\n<p>In 2016, I started working on personal projects and publishing them on GitHub. Some examples include the <a href=\"https://github.com/blopa/Magento-Chatbot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Magento Chatbot</a> extension for Magento and the <a href=\"https://github.com/blopa/Contract-Builder/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Contract Builder</a>, which I built using VueJs to help a lawyer friend create new legal contracts more efficiently.</p>\n<p>I also participated in hackathons to improve my skills, practice my English, and meet other professionals in the industry. This is how I found out about <a href=\"https://blog.vanhack.com/blog/the-vanhackathon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">VanHackathon</a>, a hackathon organized by <a href=\"http://vanhack.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">VanHack</a>. My friends and I decided to participate and created a <a href=\"https://github.com/VanHackathon/botStoreGenesis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">chatbot integration for Shopify</a> (we even made a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RnIj8g8vDw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">promotional video for it</a>). As a result, we won a <a href=\"https://vanhack.com/premium\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">VanHack Premium</a> account, which provided us with various perks and access to an exclusive Slack group.</p>\n<h2 id=\"resume-builder\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#resume-builder\" aria-label=\"resume builder permalink\" class=\"post-headers-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Resume Builder</h2>\n<p>Fast-forward to 2018, and I received a job offer to move to São Paulo. As I really enjoyed working for my current employer at the time, I declined the offer and decided to apply for other job openings to test my interviewing skills. However, I found it tedious to constantly tailor my resume for each job listing I applied to, so I created a tool to help me streamline the process: <a href=\"https://resume-builder.js.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Resume Builder</a>. You can check out the source code <a href=\"https://github.com/blopa/Resume-Builder\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> (don’t forget to star it).</p>\n<p><img src=\"/6fb4914a5988ac18a0d4ab9b84c5e9b0/resume_builder.gif\" alt=\"Resume Builder\"></p>\n<p>After a few iterations, I was satisfied with the results and decided to add the option to use custom templates (which is unfortunately not available yet in v2). I shared the tool on the VanHack Slack group, thinking it might be useful for others but didn’t think too much about it later.</p>\n<h2 id=\"job-offer\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#job-offer\" aria-label=\"job offer permalink\" class=\"post-headers-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Job offer</h2>\n<p>A few days later, a recruiter contacted me, praising the Resume Builder project and asking if I knew React. I told her that the tool was built with React (my first ever React app) and that I had no problem learning new things.</p>\n<p>She was impressed and scheduled interviews with some companies in the Netherlands for me.</p>\n<p>All of that because in the middle of thousands of developers trying to land a job abroad, I was able to stand out thanks to an open-source project that honestly wasn’t even using React’s best practices or anything like that, but it was useful and showed recruiters that I was good at solving problems, I had no problems in learning new things and that I cared about having a good resume.</p>\n<p>Back to the interviews, one of the companies sent me a React challenge to build a Q&#x26;A Single Page Application. Since I was already coding with React for a couple of weeks, I was able to finish the challenge without any trouble. That got me an interview with the Tech Lead in that company and after that with the CTO, things were looking good.</p>\n<p>So one day I was participating in a hackathon when I received an email with a job offer to move to Amsterdam. I wasn’t really planning on leaving my employer at that moment, I just got a raise, and I was in a nice project, but I knew an opportunity like that don’t knock on your door every day, so I said yes, and the rest is history 🇳🇱.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-label=\"conclusion permalink\" class=\"post-headers-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1024px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.796875%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Amsterdam canal\"\n        title=\"Amsterdam canal\"\n        src=\"/static/64cb2956c785c79783bea79d2f788549/63217/amsterdam_canal.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/64cb2956c785c79783bea79d2f788549/db830/amsterdam_canal.jpg 256w,\n/static/64cb2956c785c79783bea79d2f788549/8102f/amsterdam_canal.jpg 512w,\n/static/64cb2956c785c79783bea79d2f788549/63217/amsterdam_canal.jpg 1024w,\n/static/64cb2956c785c79783bea79d2f788549/d58d1/amsterdam_canal.jpg 1536w,\n/static/64cb2956c785c79783bea79d2f788549/09658/amsterdam_canal.jpg 2048w,\n/static/64cb2956c785c79783bea79d2f788549/441eb/amsterdam_canal.jpg 6000w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span>\n    <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\">Amsterdam canal</figcaption>\n  </figure></p>\n<p>When I look back on how I landed this job in Amsterdam, it all comes down to a simple open-source project with a mediocre idea, but <span\n          \n          class='highlighted-text'\n        >it was something more than just having a resume</span> with my name and a list of activities and skills that are really hard to stand out when all other resumes are doing the same thing.</p>\n<p><span\n          \n          class='highlighted-text'\n        >If you really want to work abroad, you need to put yourself out there</span>, not necessarily only by making an open-source project, but by expanding your portfolio in a way that is meaningful to you.

the world. This sparked my sense of wanderlust and desire to discover new places and cultures.</p>\n<p>As I grew older, I realized that the world was vast and full of opportunities, and I didn’t want to be confined to just one little town in Brazil. So, I made the decision to pursue my dream of living and working abroad. In this post, I will share my journey and how an open source project played a role in landing me a job abroad.</p>\n<h2 id=\"open-source-projects-and-hackathons\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#open-source-projects-and-hackathons\" aria-label=\"open source projects and hackathons permalink\" class=\"post-headers-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Open Source projects and hackathons</h2>\n<p>In 2016, I started working on personal projects and publishing them on GitHub. Some examples include the <a href=\"https://github.com/blopa/Magento-Chatbot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Magento Chatbot</a> extension for Magento and the <a href=\"https://github.com/blopa/Contract-Builder/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Contract Builder</a>, which I built using VueJs to help a lawyer friend create new legal contracts more efficiently.</p>\n<p>I also participated in hackathons to improve my skills, practice my English, and meet other professionals in the industry. This is how I found out about <a href=\"https://blog.vanhack.com/blog/the-vanhackathon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">VanHackathon</a>, a hackathon organized by <a href=\"http://vanhack.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">VanHack</a>. My friends and I decided to participate and created a <a href=\"https://github.com/VanHackathon/botStoreGenesis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">chatbot integration for Shopify</a> (we even made a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RnIj8g8vDw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">promotional video for it</a>). As a result, we won a <a href=\"https://vanhack.com/premium\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">VanHack Premium</a> account, which provided us with various perks and access to an exclusive Slack group.</p>\n<h2 id=\"resume-builder\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#resume-builder\" aria-label=\"resume builder permalink\" class=\"post-headers-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Resume Builder</h2>\n<p>Fast-forward to 2018, and I received a job offer to move to São Paulo. As I really enjoyed working for my current employer at the time, I declined the offer and decided to apply for other job openings to test my interviewing skills. However, I found it tedious to constantly tailor my resume for each job listing I applied to, so I created a tool to help me streamline the process: <a href=\"https://resume-builder.js.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Resume Builder</a>. You can check out the source code <a href=\"https://github.com/blopa/Resume-Builder\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> (don’t forget to star it).</p>\n<p><img src=\"/6fb4914a5988ac18a0d4ab9b84c5e9b0/resume_builder.gif\" alt=\"Resume Builder\"></p>\n<p>After a few iterations, I was satisfied with the results and decided to add the option to use custom templates (which is unfortunately not available yet in v2). I shared the tool on the VanHack Slack group, thinking it might be useful for others but didn’t think too much about it later.</p>\n<h2 id=\"job-offer\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#job-offer\" aria-label=\"job offer permalink\" class=\"post-headers-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Job offer</h2>\n<p>A few days later, a recruiter contacted me, praising the Resume Builder project and asking if I knew React. I told her that the tool was built with React (my first ever React app) and that I had no problem learning new things.</p>\n<p>She was impressed and scheduled interviews with some companies in the Netherlands for me.</p>\n<p>All of that because in the middle of thousands of developers trying to land a job abroad, I was able to stand out thanks to an open-source project that honestly wasn’t even using React’s best practices or anything like that, but it was useful and showed recruiters that I was good at solving problems, I had no problems in learning new things and that I cared about having a good resume.</p>\n<p>Back to the interviews, one of the companies sent me a React challenge to build a Q&amp;A Single Page Application. Since I was already coding with React for a couple of weeks, I was able to finish the challenge without any trouble. That got me an interview with the Tech Lead in that company and after that with the CTO, things were looking good.</p>\n<p>So one day I was participating in a hackathon when I received an email with a job offer to move to Amsterdam. I wasn’t really planning on leaving my employer at that moment, I just got a raise, and I was in a nice project, but I knew an opportunity like that don’t knock on your door every day, so I said yes, and the rest is history 🇳🇱.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-label=\"conclusion permalink\" class=\"post-headers-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p></p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1024px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.796875%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Amsterdam canal\" title=\"Amsterdam canal\" src=\"/static/64cb2956c785c79783bea79d2f788549/63217/amsterdam_canal.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/64cb2956c785c79783bea79d2f788549/db830/amsterdam_canal.jpg 256w,\n/static/64cb2956c785c79783bea79d2f788549/8102f/amsterdam_canal.jpg 512w,\n/static/64cb2956c785c79783bea79d2f788549/63217/amsterdam_canal.jpg 1024w,\n/static/64cb2956c785c79783bea79d2f788549/d58d1/amsterdam_canal.jpg 1536w,\n/static/64cb2956c785c79783bea79d2f788549/09658/amsterdam_canal.jpg 2048w,\n/static/64cb2956c785c79783bea79d2f788549/441eb/amsterdam_canal.jpg 6000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n    </span>\n    <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\">Amsterdam canal</figcaption>\n  </figure><p></p>\n<p>When I look back on how I landed this job in Amsterdam, it all comes down to a simple open-source project with a mediocre idea, but <span class=\"highlighted-text\">it was something more than just having a resume</span> with my name and a list of activities and skills that are really hard to stand out when all other resumes are doing the same thing.</p>\n<p><span class=\"highlighted-text\">If you really want to work abroad, you need to put yourself out there</span>, not necessarily only by making an open-source project, but by expanding your portfolio in a way that is meaningful to you.

Nessas pesquisas eu acabei descobrindo o <a href=\"https://blog.vanhack.com/blog/the-vanhackathon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">VanHackathon</a>, uma Hackathon do site <a href=\"https://vanhack.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">VanHack</a>. Eu conversei com alguns amigos meus e decidimos nos juntar e participar desse evento, nós fizemos uma <a href=\"https://github.com/VanHackathon/botStoreGenesis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">integração de chatbot para o Shopify</a> (fizemos até um <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RnIj8g8vDw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">vídeo promocional para esse projeto</a>), e fomos uns dos vencedores do evento e como prêmio ganhamos uma conta <a href=\"https://vanhack.com/premium\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">VanHack Premium</a>, que nos deu algumas vantagens no site e acesso a um Slack exclusivo.</p>\n<h2 id=\"resume-builder\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#resume-builder\" aria-label=\"resume builder permalink\" class=\"post-headers-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Resume Builder</h2>\n<p>Um tempo depois em 2018 eu recebi uma oferta de emprego para me mudar para São Paulo, mas como eu estava bem satisfeito na minha empresa da época, eu recusei a oferta, mas isso me fez querer testar minhas habilidades de entrevista com outras empresas, então eu me inscrevi em algumas vagas de emprego, e toda hora que eu ia enviar o meu currículo para uma vaga, eu tinha que mudar algo, pois eu estava mandando uma versão do meu currículo que mostrava as minhas habilidades relevantes para aquela vaga, e isso estava me tomando MUITO tempo 😫. Cansado de ficar mudando o meu currículo manualmente toda hora, eu decidi criar uma ferramenta para me ajudar com isso, e foi assim que o <a href=\"https://resume-builder.js.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Resume Builder</a> nasceu. Você pode acessar o código-fonte do projeto <a href=\"https://github.com/blopa/Resume-Builder\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">aqui</a> (não esqueça de deixar sua estrelinha).</p>\n<p><img src=\"/6fb4914a5988ac18a0d4ab9b84c5e9b0/resume_builder.gif\" alt=\"Resume Builder\"></p>\n<p>Após adicionar várias features para a ferramenta, eu percebi que ela poderia ser útil para outras pessoas também, então decidi adicionar a opção de criar currículos com temas personalizados (que infelizmente ainda não está disponível na v2) e compartilhei o projeto no Slack do VanHack e meio que deixei para lá.</p>\n<h2 id=\"oferta-de-emprego\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#oferta-de-emprego\" aria-label=\"oferta de emprego permalink\" class=\"post-headers-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Oferta de emprego</h2>\n<p>Alguns dias depois, uma recrutadora entrou em contato comigo, parabenizando pelo projeto e me perguntando se eu sabia programar React. Bom, o Resume Builder foi feito com React e foi meu primeiro projeto com React, então eu disse isso a ela, e ela ficou impressionada e me agendou algumas entrevistas com empresas na Holanda. Eu estava muito empolgado!</p>\n<p>Tudo isso porque no meio de milhares de desenvolvedores tentando conseguir um emprego no exterior, eu fui capaz de me destacar graças a um projeto open source que honestamente nem estava usando as melhores práticas do React ou algo assim, mas foi um projeto útil, e mostrou aos recrutadores que eu era bom em resolver problemas, não tinha dificuldades em aprender coisas novas e que me preocupava em ter um bom currículo.</p>\n<p>Voltando às entrevistas, uma das empresas me enviou um desafio de React para construir um <em>Single Page Application</em> de perguntas e respostas, clássico.

Isso despertou meu desejo de viajar e desejo de descobrir novos lugares e culturas.\r\n\r\nÀ medida que fui crescendo, percebi que o mundo era vasto e cheio de oportunidades, e não queria ficar confinado a apenas uma cidadezinha do Brasil. Então, tomei a decisão de seguir meu sonho de morar e trabalhar no exterior. Neste post, compartilharei minha jornada e como um projeto de código aberto desempenhou um papel importante para me conseguir um emprego no exterior.\r\n\r\n## Projetos Open Source e hackathons\r\nPor volta de 2016 eu comecei a trabalhar em alguns projetos pessoais e publicá-los no GitHub, como a extensão [Magento Chatbot](https://github.com/blopa/Magento-Chatbot) para Magento e o [Contract Builder](https://github.com/blopa/Contract-Builder/), que fiz para testar VueJs e ajudar uma amiga advogada que estava perdendo muito tempo criando os mesmos tipos de contrato o tempo todo.\r\n\r\nEu também estava sempre procurando hackathons para participar, pois, queria melhorar minhas habilidades de programação, praticar meu inglês e conhecer novas pessoas da indústria. Nessas pesquisas eu acabei descobrindo o [VanHackathon](https://blog.vanhack.com/blog/the-vanhackathon/), uma Hackathon do site [VanHack](https://vanhack.com/). Eu conversei com alguns amigos meus e decidimos nos juntar e participar desse evento, nós fizemos uma [integração de chatbot para o Shopify](https://github.com/VanHackathon/botStoreGenesis) (fizemos até um [vídeo promocional para esse projeto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RnIj8g8vDw)), e fomos uns dos vencedores do evento e como prêmio ganhamos uma conta [VanHack Premium](https://vanhack.com/premium), que nos deu algumas vantagens no site e acesso a um Slack exclusivo.\r\n\r\n## Resume Builder\r\nUm tempo depois em 2018 eu recebi uma oferta de emprego para me mudar para São Paulo, mas como eu estava bem satisfeito na minha empresa da época, eu recusei a oferta, mas isso me fez querer testar minhas habilidades de entrevista com outras empresas, então eu me inscrevi em algumas vagas de emprego, e toda hora que eu ia enviar o meu currículo para uma vaga, eu tinha que mudar algo, pois eu estava mandando uma versão do meu currículo que mostrava as minhas habilidades relevantes para aquela vaga, e isso estava me tomando MUITO tempo 😫. Cansado de ficar mudando o meu currículo manualmente toda hora, eu decidi criar uma ferramenta para me ajudar com isso, e foi assim que o [Resume Builder](https://resume-builder.js.org/) nasceu. Você pode acessar o código-fonte do projeto [aqui](https://github.com/blopa/Resume-Builder) (não esqueça de deixar sua estrelinha).\r\n\r\n![Resume Builder](../../uploads/blog/2020/09/resume_builder.gif)\r\n\r\nApós adicionar várias features para a ferramenta, eu percebi que ela poderia ser útil para outras pessoas também, então decidi adicionar a opção de criar currículos com temas personalizados (que infelizmente ainda não está disponível na v2) e compartilhei o projeto no Slack do VanHack e meio que deixei para lá.\r\n\r\n## Oferta de emprego\r\nAlguns dias depois, uma recrutadora entrou em contato comigo, parabenizando pelo projeto e me perguntando se eu sabia programar React. Bom, o Resume Builder foi feito com React e foi meu primeiro projeto com React, então eu disse isso a ela, e ela ficou impressionada e me agendou algumas entrevistas com empresas na Holanda. Eu estava muito empolgado!\r\n\r\nTudo isso porque no meio de milhares de desenvolvedores tentando conseguir um emprego no exterior, eu fui capaz de me destacar graças a um projeto open source que honestamente nem estava usando as melhores práticas do React ou algo assim, mas foi um projeto útil, e mostrou aos recrutadores que eu era bom em resolver problemas, não tinha dificuldades em aprender coisas novas e que me preocupava em ter um bom currículo.\r\n\r\nVoltando às entrevistas, uma das empresas me enviou um desafio de React para construir um _Single Page Application_ de perguntas e respostas, clássico. Como já estava programando com React há um tempinho, consegui terminar o desafio sem problemas em poucos dias. Após entregar o projeto para a recrutadora, eu avancei para uma entrevista com o líder técnico dessa empresa e, depois disso, com o CTO, as coisas estavam indo bem.\r\n\r\nAté que um dia eu estava participando de outro hackathon, quando recebi um e-mail com uma oferta de trabalhar nessa empresa e me mudar para Amsterdam. Eu não estava planejando deixar meu trabalho naquela época, pois eu tinha acabado de receber um aumento e estava em um projeto muito irado, mas sabia que uma oportunidade como essa não bate na sua porta diariamente né, então eu disse sim para a vaga e o resto é história 🇳🇱.\r\n\r\n## Conclusão\r\n![Canal de Amsterdam](../../uploads/blog/2020/09/amsterdam_canal.jpg)\r\n\r\nQuando olho para trás e vejo como consegui este emprego em Amsterdam, tudo se resume a um simples projeto open source com uma ideia que nem é tão incrível assim (não é incrível at all), mas ajudou, porque já era -#mais do que apenas ter um currículo#- com meu nome e uma lista de atividades e habilidades, que são realmente difíceis de se destacar quando todos os outros currículos estão fazendo a mesma coisa.\r\n\r\n-#Se você realmente quer trabalhar no exterior, tem que se destacar de alguma forma#-, não necessariamente fazendo um projeto de open source, mas expandindo seu portfólio de uma maneira que seja significativa para você.
