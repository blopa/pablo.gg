It just sounded too heavy metal for me, and since I was at the peak of my skateboarding ‚Äúcareer‚Äù, I was really into punk and hardcore music at the time. That all changed when a friend told me about the band‚Äôs album with the San Francisco Symphony. I was intrigued and decided to borrow the CD. And let me tell you, I became a huge Metallica fan almost instantly.</p>\n<p>I couldn‚Äôt get enough of S&#x26;M and listened to it nonstop. And after I knew all the songs by heart, I started delving into the rest of Metallica‚Äôs discography. Around that time, the band released St. Anger, which I absolutely loved (even though I know it‚Äôs not a fan favorite). I listened to all of Metallica‚Äôs albums, but S&#x26;M remained my favorite and I still listened to it often.</p>\n<h2 id=\"attending-metallica-concerts-in-brazil\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#attending-metallica-concerts-in-brazil\" aria-label=\"attending metallica concerts in brazil permalink\" class=\"post-headers-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Attending Metallica concerts in Brazil</h2>\n<p>In 2005, I hoped that Metallica would come to Brazil and maybe even perform with a Brazilian symphony. As it turned out, the band didn‚Äôt come to Brazil until 2010 for its Death Magnetic tour. I was there and had an amazing time with friends. The show sold out in one day, so they added a second show the following day.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1024px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"me and friends metallica 2010\"\n        title=\"Metallica second day concert in 2010\"\n        src=\"/static/c841ded084fc5c49fc47fa6f2aca646d/63217/me_and_friends_metallica_2010.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/c841ded084fc5c49fc47fa6f2aca646d/db830/me_and_friends_metallica_2010.jpg 256w,\n/static/c841ded084fc5c49fc47fa6f2aca646d/8102f/me_and_friends_metallica_2010.jpg 512w,\n/static/c841ded084fc5c49fc47fa6f2aca646d/63217/me_and_friends_metallica_2010.jpg 1024w,\n/static/c841ded084fc5c49fc47fa6f2aca646d/d58d1/me_and_friends_metallica_2010.jpg 1536w,\n/static/c841ded084fc5c49fc47fa6f2aca646d/09658/me_and_friends_metallica_2010.jpg 2048w,\n/static/c841ded084fc5c49fc47fa6f2aca646d/998db/me_and_friends_metallica_2010.jpg 3072w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span>\n    <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\">Metallica second day concert in 2010</figcaption>\n  </figure></p>\n<p>After that, I went to a few more Metallica concerts in Brazil, including at Rock in Rio.

I took a Lyft from my hostel to the Chase Center and couldn‚Äôt believe that I was really there. The line to get into the venue was huge, but I didn‚Äôt mind ‚Äì I was just thrilled to be there.</p>\n<p>As I found my seat with a perfect view of the stage, the concert began. It was an incredible experience to see Metallica and the San Francisco Symphony perform together, like a dream come true.</p>\n<p>They opened with <em>The Ecstasy Of Gold</em>, followed by <em>The Call Of Ktulu</em>, just like the first S&#x26;M concert. I was living my dream, listening to my favorite album live.</p>\n<p>The third song was also from the first S&#x26;M concert, <em>For Whom The Bell Tolls</em>, and the fourth song was <em>The Day That Never Comes</em> from Death Magnetic, which is my second-favorite Metallica album. I was overjoyed.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1024px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"metallica and symphony 1\"\n        title=\"Symphony and Metallica 2\"\n        src=\"/static/b1faaf3dd0ddd7c0f9b7a8ae017c9128/63217/metallica_and_symphony_1.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/b1faaf3dd0ddd7c0f9b7a8ae017c9128/db830/metallica_and_symphony_1.jpg 256w,\n/static/b1faaf3dd0ddd7c0f9b7a8ae017c9128/8102f/metallica_and_symphony_1.jpg 512w,\n/static/b1faaf3dd0ddd7c0f9b7a8ae017c9128/63217/metallica_and_symphony_1.jpg 1024w,\n/static/b1faaf3dd0ddd7c0f9b7a8ae017c9128/d58d1/metallica_and_symphony_1.jpg 1536w,\n/static/b1faaf3dd0ddd7c0f9b7a8ae017c9128/09658/metallica_and_symphony_1.jpg 2048w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span>\n    <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\">Symphony and Metallica 2</figcaption>\n  </figure></p>\n<p>We all knew <em>The Unforgiven III</em> had to be played that day, and it was epic.

Last year‚Äôs E3 was very epic, especially the part of Nintendo‚Äôs conference (which I won‚Äôt be attending this year ‚Ä¶), not only for the conference itself, but for the adventure I went through to attend it, it happened that the internet went down well in the middle of the presentation, which made me and my fellow Nintendista Luca have to run out of the house, get a ride to go to someone else‚Äôs house to watch the conference, and well, we did it. Everything worked out in the end.</p>\n<p>Why won‚Äôt I attend the Nintendo conference? Well, it‚Äôs simple. After years of wishing, my presence at E3 is confirmed, I will be part of the <a href=\"https://www.nintendoblast.com.br/2012/05/e3-2012-nintendo-blast-fara-cobertura.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nintendo Blast team</a> that will cover the event.</p>\n<p>We were divided into two groups: Those who will attend the conference live and those who stayed at the event, covering what happens while the conference is going on, and I was in the group that will stay at the event, which is extremely AWESOME, but I will miss watch and learn first hand what Nintendo has to say for its future releases.</p>\n<p>So many things that I could have done posts about events that happened recently, like a lot of knowledge about Magento that I acquired in the last two years, and I also never posted the programming tutorials for cell phones. Well, now Symbian is also a dead OS, who knows, I may not reuse this idea for something broader and more current, like Android.</p>\n<p>What really matters is: FUCK YEAH I‚ÄôM GOING TO E3! I still don‚Äôt believe it. I promise you, faithful readers, that I will post here again one day. One day‚Ä¶</p>","fields":{"postHashId":"ZXZlbnRzdHJ1ZS4uLy4uL2NvdmVycy8yMDEyL3Bvc3QtaWQtMjIyMS1jb3Zlci5wbmcyMDEyLTA1LTMxVDAwOjAwOjAwLjAwMFo=","slug":"/2012/2012-05-31-e3-2012-and-here-we-go.en/","path":"/blog/events/e3-2012-and-here-we-go/","locale":"en"},"frontmatter":{"categories":["events"],"allowComments":true,"publishOnMedium":false,"cover":"../../covers/2012/post-id-2221-cover.png","date":"2012-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","id":2221,"path":"e3-2012-and-here-we-go","show":true,"title":"E3 2012 - And here we...

It was beautiful, I went to the penultimate day of distribution, at Saraiva Mega Store in New York City Center - Rio de Janeiro. Once there, countless Pok√©mon fans talking, battling, exchanging Pok√©mon - The place was filled with Nintendo fans. I became friends with people there, we played a few games of Mario Kart DS while we waited for the Jirachi distributor to come back from lunch. As soon as he returned, I started turning on my DSi to get Jirachi! It was really cool !!!</p>\n<p>I had the opportunity to speak with the Jirachi distributor, Diego. He explained that the starting point for this event to happen was Nintendo‚Äôs contact with Latamel. That‚Äôs right !! Nintendo has an eye on Brazil, interested in doing events, and as this was a success, more are yet to come! LET‚ÄôS GO!
