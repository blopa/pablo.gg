It felt like a distant dream, just the idea of going to E3 was already exciting enough. At the time, I didn’t even realize that E3 was an event for media press only and that I wouldn’t be able to just buy a ticket and attend. Of course, I eventually did get to go to E3, but how?</p>\n<p>As a huge fan of video games, especially Nintendo games, I applied to be an editor for Nintendo Blast, the biggest Brazilian blog about Nintendo. I was accepted and started writing blog posts and making videos for their YouTube channel. A few years later, I received an email from one of the blog managers saying they were looking for people to travel to Los Angeles to cover E3. I was over the moon and applied right away.</p>\n<p>Since Nintendo Blast was a voluntary work, I had to pay for my own trip, but they would offer me something money couldn’t buy: a media badge.</p>\n<p>I had to go through the process of getting a visa to enter the US, which was quite bureaucratic, but fortunately, my visa was approved. The hotel and tickets were booked and our media badges were issued, and all I had to do was wait for the day of the trip. I was so excited that I had trouble sleeping for months.</p>\n<h2 id=\"first-time-in-los-angeles\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#first-time-in-los-angeles\" aria-label=\"first time in los angeles permalink\" class=\"post-headers-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>First time in Los Angeles</h2>\n<p>Attending E3 had an unexpected side effect: I fell in love with Los Angeles. It’s cliché, I know, but LA is not only the home of E3, but also the home of many famous skate spots that I had seen in skate videos my whole life. Being able to visit these spots in person was very emotional for me, and I even bought a Plan B deck while I was there. Downtown LA is practically filled with famous skate spots from 90s skate parts.</p>\n<p>This was also my first time in the US, so I experienced many new things, like extra-large meals at McDonald’s, shopping at Target, receiving massive receipts from CVS, going to a GameStop, buying Old Spice products, going to White Castle, and, as a Forest Gump fan, finally visiting a Bubba Gump restaurant.</p>\n<p>We were a group of seven young video game enthusiasts, ready to cover the biggest video game event in the world. We had lots of things we wanted to do in LA, but we had no time to waste as E3 was starting just two days after we arrived.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-little-help-from-the-veterans\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#a-little-help-from-the-veterans\" aria-label=\"a little help from the veterans permalink\" class=\"post-headers-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>A little help from the veterans</h2>\n<p>Despite being a small team, we were fortunate enough to be staying at the same hotel as several veteran editors from Nintendo World, the official Nintendo magazine in Brazil. As someone who has been a fan of Nintendo World since childhood, it was a surreal experience to be there with these legends.</p>\n<p>In fact, some of us were even given the opportunity to write a guest article for the magazine - although unfortunately, I was not selected. Nevertheless, just being considered for the opportunity was one of the greatest achievements of my life so far.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1024px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 132.03125%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAaABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGQAAAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMCBAUB/8QAFgEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgAD/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAFk7Cy+kSmprCw1zFHn/8QAHhAAAQQBBQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgABAxIhBBETICL/2gAIAQEAAQUCIarjwEQkzPYpjCkWnxM+4j6TH0//xAAZEQEAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERMBUWH/2gAIAQMBAT8BlOdrF3H/xAAWEQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEhD/2gAIAQIBAT8ByUP/xAAiEAACAgEBCQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIRUSISEyAhMjNBYYH/2gAIAQEABj8C1RR2zoj9JbyK0tUSjtVY78vI45KnzXtFY4P/xAAeEAACAgICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAABEQAhMUEQYYGRof/aAAgBAQABPyFpkeVDl9mYwP8AuU3iw1CljXkw4MewdILKNSgEjdaogAESoL4V8f/aAAwDAQACAAMAAAAQoOi9/8QAGREBAQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARQWHw/9oACAEDAQE/EM3d5McSxn//xAAaEQEBAAIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABABEhMVFh/9oACAECAQE/EACwdT6jTm//xAAcEAEBAAIDAQEAAAAAAAAAAAABEQAhMUFxUWH/2gAIAQEAAT8QJutMitmpqVyN9groe8Y1IL0UaO+z3Gu/pkTzvt4xLqLZC0rZrg/MrzaRVQTBGG8iIH1+76xwZeIeOcnww0eIfuAQ0YjqYhXRn//Z'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Nintendo World #159\"\n        title=\"Nintendo World #159\"\n        src=\"/static/1bd637a064f5ba27be82ffab40d2d631/63217/nintendo_world_159.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/1bd637a064f5ba27be82ffab40d2d631/db830/nintendo_world_159.jpg 256w,\n/static/1bd637a064f5ba27be82ffab40d2d631/8102f/nintendo_world_159.jpg 512w,\n/static/1bd637a064f5ba27be82ffab40d2d631/63217/nintendo_world_159.jpg 1024w,\n/static/1bd637a064f5ba27be82ffab40d2d631/d58d1/nintendo_world_159.jpg 1536w,\n/static/1bd637a064f5ba27be82ffab40d2d631/d7bd3/nintendo_world_159.jpg 1933w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span>\n    <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\">Nintendo World #159</figcaption>\n  </figure></p>\n<p>In addition, we participated in several meetings on how to make the most of our time at E3, which proved to be extremely valuable and have proven useful at every E3 I’ve attended since then.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wait-when-does-e3-starts\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#wait-when-does-e3-starts\" aria-label=\"wait when does e3 starts permalink\" class=\"post-headers-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Wait, when does E3 starts?</h2>\n<p>Every E3, I would see articles stating when the event was supposed to start, only to have the Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo conferences happen a few days earlier.</p>\n<p>These conferences, while not technically part of E3, are still closely associated with the event. E3, organized by the Entertainment Software Association (ESA), is a trade show where gaming companies can showcase their products and new game releases to media and traders.</p>\n<p>During this time, the entire gaming industry is focused on E3, leading major companies to schedule press conferences a few days beforehand to give attendees an idea of what to expect at the event.</p>\n<p>However, for those of us watching from home, it can be confusing as E3 seems to begin with the start of the conferences and end after the final conference.</p>\n<p>I remember being surprised when I was told that the Sony conference was being held at a location far from the Los Angeles Convention Center (LACC), as I had assumed all conferences were held at the LACC as part of E3. It was a shock to me, and in the years since, I’ve noticed that many other E3 attendees have had similar confusion.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-conferences\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-conferences\" aria-label=\"the conferences permalink\" class=\"post-headers-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The conferences</h2>\n<p>Typically, access to the highly sought-after E3 conferences requires an invitation. However, many media professionals still make the journey to the conference location in the hope of securing a last-minute spot. In my experience, I have always been able to attend the conferences, even if it meant making phone calls and reaching out to PR professionals to try and secure a spot. On one occasion, I didn’t even try to attend a conference, only to later learn that it was the last year that Nintendo held a traditional E3 conference.</p>\n<p>The conferences are typically scheduled at specific times and locations to allow attendees to move from one to the next. A typical conference day might include a Microsoft conference in the morning, followed by Ubisoft, a lunch break, and finally, Sony. There are even special buses that provide transportation between the conferences for free - I’m not sure where these buses come from, but they are incredibly helpful.</p>\n<p>Many conferences also provide attendees with souvenirs such as pins, t-shirts, and action figures. These items can often be found for sale on eBay for hundreds of dollars later the same day. Personally, I have kept all of the souvenirs I have received and still wear at least one E3 t-shirt every week.</p>\n<p>The locations of the conferences are always iconic places in Los Angeles, such as the Dolby Theater on Hollywood Boulevard where the Bethesda conferences were held in 2015, or the LA Memorial Sports Arena and Galen Center, where Sony and Microsoft conferences are typically held.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-event\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-event\" aria-label=\"the event permalink\" class=\"post-headers-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The Event</h2>\n<p>E3 typically takes place over the course of three days, from Tuesday to Thursday. However, if you want to see everything, three days is not enough. Attending the event is an incredible experience, but it’s easy to miss out on a lot of things due to the sheer size of the Los Angeles Convention Center (LACC) and the time it takes to walk from booth to booth.</p>\n<p>To make the most of our time at E3, our team split up into smaller groups and booked slots for hands-on demos, interviews, and presentations with various publishers in advance. This allowed us to skip the long lines and go straight to the hands-on experiences. As I mentioned before, three days is not a lot of time to see everything, so it’s important to try to avoid wasting time waiting in lines.</p>\n<p>During my first year at E3, I was a bit lost and wasn’t sure what to do, but I still managed to play a lot of games for the Wii U and PS3, including ZombiU, Nintendo Land, LittleBigPlanet Karting, and PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale. My favorite game from that year, however, was not playable - Dead Space 3. That’s when I became a fan of the series and received a nice beanie, which I still have to this day.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 612px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 133.203125%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Dead Space beenie\"\n        title=\"Dead Space beenie\"\n        src=\"/static/ab69ba0d7bcc1956e599f91a725c55b5/6c4e2/dead_space_beenie.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/ab69ba0d7bcc1956e599f91a725c55b5/db830/dead_space_beenie.jpg 256w,\n/static/ab69ba0d7bcc1956e599f91a725c55b5/8102f/dead_space_beenie.jpg 512w,\n/static/ab69ba0d7bcc1956e599f91a725c55b5/6c4e2/dead_space_beenie.jpg 612w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span>\n    <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\">Dead Space beenie</figcaption>\n  </figure></p>\n<p>The LACC is divided into two main areas where you can find booths from various companies, as well as several meeting rooms where companies often have VIP areas with closed presentations and demos. These two main areas are connected by a large open area that is open to the public and also full of activities, including exclusive games to play. It takes about 10 minutes to walk from one main area to the other, so it’s important to try to book appointments that are close to each other to avoid getting stuck in the middle of the open area.</p>\n<p>There is also a special room for media with computers and high-speed internet, allowing journalists to quickly edit and publish their articles and videos. Additionally, there is a “chill” room where we could relax and get a free lunch around noon.</p>\n<p>During our free time, we could explore and find interesting things to cover. Personally, I spent most of my free time at Nintendo’s booth, trying to play as many games as possible and collect as many souvenirs (also known as “swag”) as I could. One of the best things about E3 is the opportunity to receive a wide variety of free items, such as keychains, t-shirts, and action figures.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-swags\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-swags\" aria-label=\"the swags permalink\" class=\"post-headers-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The swags</h2>\n<p>One of the most exciting aspects of E3 is collecting “swags”, or free souvenirs. Each company booth has its own unique swags and ways to obtain them, which change from year to year. At the Nintendo booth during my first E3, for example, we could earn a pin for each mini-game we played in Nintendo Land, with the goal of collecting them all (which I was able to do).</p>\n<p>Some swags required playing a game against other attendees and winning in order to obtain them, such as the 2014 Smash shirt - although I’m not very good at Smash, my friend Danilo from Hyrule Legends was able to secure one for me. Other swags could be obtained simply by asking, although they could also “sell out” quickly and need to be waited for the next day to obtain.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1024px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Nintendo Land pins\"\n        title=\"Nintendo Land pins\"\n        src=\"/static/bcbc5e01cc243731110599099965072c/63217/nintendo_land_swags.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/bcbc5e01cc243731110599099965072c/db830/nintendo_land_swags.jpg 256w,\n/static/bcbc5e01cc243731110599099965072c/8102f/nintendo_land_swags.jpg 512w,\n/static/bcbc5e01cc243731110599099965072c/63217/nintendo_land_swags.jpg 1024w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span>\n    <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\">Nintendo Land pins</figcaption>\n  </figure></p>\n<p>As a collector, I always appreciate receiving swags, but the ones that are most useful are the ones that can be worn.

I made sure to get there early to avoid long lines and make the most of my time there. I spent the majority of my day playing games and exploring all that the convention had to offer. It wasn’t uncommon for me to be there until the event ended for the day at 6:00 PM. By that point, I was usually pretty exhausted.</p>\n<p>But the fun didn’t stop there. After a long day at E3, I would often meet up with my friends and gather my gear before heading out to explore the vibrant nightlife of LA. There was always a party happening somewhere, and I was always game to join in on the fun. Some of these parties were exclusive to media professionals, while others were open to any game enthusiast in the area. Some were paid events, while others were free. Some offered free food and drinks, while others had swag to give away. No matter what type of party it was, there was always something for everyone to enjoy.</p>\n<p>The best part of these parties, for me, was getting the chance to meet new people and hang out with my friends. We would spend hours talking about the day’s events and getting hyped about all the new releases that were coming that year. It was a great way to unwind after a long day at E3 and make some lasting memories with like-minded individuals.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1024px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 66.796875%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"PC Game Show party\"\n        title=\"PC Game Show party\"\n        src=\"/static/9b7cb544792f5e0a25356d10bd77cf9c/63217/pc_game_show_party.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/9b7cb544792f5e0a25356d10bd77cf9c/db830/pc_game_show_party.jpg 256w,\n/static/9b7cb544792f5e0a25356d10bd77cf9c/8102f/pc_game_show_party.jpg 512w,\n/static/9b7cb544792f5e0a25356d10bd77cf9c/63217/pc_game_show_party.jpg 1024w,\n/static/9b7cb544792f5e0a25356d10bd77cf9c/d58d1/pc_game_show_party.jpg 1536w,\n/static/9b7cb544792f5e0a25356d10bd77cf9c/97b1a/pc_game_show_party.jpg 1576w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span>\n    <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\">PC Game Show party</figcaption>\n  </figure></p>\n<h2 id=\"post-e3\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#post-e3\" aria-label=\"post e3 permalink\" class=\"post-headers-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Post E3</h2>\n<p>During my first trip to E3, we barely had time to explore all the other things Los Angeles had to offer - like walking around Santa Monica pier, visiting retro gaming stores like Game Dude, and checking out Universal Studios, the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and the Hollywood Sign. We were only there for a week, which was just enough time to attend the conferences and the main event, and have an extra day for shopping.</p>\n<p>On all my subsequent trips to E3, I made sure to stay for at least two weeks. That gave us plenty of time to fully experience E3, as well as explore all the other things LA has to offer. After the event was over, my friends and I always had a whole week to do things like hunt for game deals, eat as much junk food as we could, and do all the other touristy things. One time, we even took a weekend trip to Las Vegas - it was amazing!</p>\n<h2 id=\"going-back-home\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#going-back-home\" aria-label=\"going back home permalink\" class=\"post-headers-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Going back home</h2>\n<p>Saying goodbye to E3 was always the saddest moment of the trip, especially during my first year when I was not only saying goodbye to the event, but also to my first trip to LA, which had been an unforgettable experience.</p>\n<p>Returning home was always a bit bittersweet, but at least I knew I would have the opportunity to come back to LA again the following year.

The truth is that E3 was already struggling prior to the pandemic, and the pandemic was the final blow that ended the event. E3 could not survive as a media-only event, as it no longer made financial sense for news companies to send journalists to Los Angeles to cover the event when everything could be easily shown on YouTube.</p>\n<p>When E3 opened to the public in 2017, the event was not prepared for such a large audience and it resulted in extremely long lines - for example, there were reportedly 5 hours of wait time to watch the presentation of Cyberpunk 2077, in addition to long lines just to enter the event. The Electronic Software Association (ESA), which organizes E3, was also facing challenges before E3 2020 was canceled, as Geoff Keighley had already announced he would not be attending the event that year.</p>\n<p>While it may seem like there’s no need for E3 anymore, as conferences can be held online and game demos can be made available for everyone to play, there is one thing that cannot be fully replicated in the digital world: the hype. E3 is a great tool for creating buzz and increasing hype around game releases, as all gaming enthusiasts are paying attention to everything that happens at the event. It’s practically a week when all of our gamer dreams come true, as we get to look forward to what’s coming in the next year. It’s like Christmas, but better.</p>\n<p>Without E3, we don’t know what to expect from the gaming industry in the year. This is why even without E3, many companies still used the E3 time frame to announce their new games in 2020, but it’s just not the same without the big in-person event. Plus, there’s something special about being able to physically be at the event and see everything in person. It adds to the excitement and creates a more immersive experience.</p>\n<p>For example, there are still movie trailers shown at Comic-Con. Why do they show trailers at Comic-Con weeks before they are released on YouTube? It’s because this creates anticipation and excitement for finally seeing the trailers, as we know others have already seen it and are reading reactions and comments about it. E3 is the same way, but for games. I attended Gamescom in 2019 and it was a great event, but many of the games that were there had already been announced and the closed presentations were similar to those at E3. Despite being an event that is up to three times larger than E3, it doesn’t create the same level of hype.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-now\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#what-now\" aria-label=\"what now permalink\" class=\"post-headers-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What now?</h2>\n<p>It’s still uncertain if E3 2023 will happen or not, but with the pandemic hopefully coming to an end in the near future, there’s a good chance that the Electronic Software Association (ESA) will be able to bring E3 back next year. If that happens, count me in! I always look forward to attending E3, as it’s not only an opportunity for me to play amazing games and meet new people, but it’s also a chance for me to have an awesome trip with my friends. It can be difficult for us to all get together, since we have busy schedules and live in different countries.</p>\n<p>E3 is such a special event for the gaming community, and it’s a shame that it had to be canceled in 2020 and 2021 due to the pandemic. But I have high hopes that it will return in 2023, and I can’t wait to experience all the excitement and hype that comes with it. From the big game announcements to the hands-on demos, there’s just nothing like being at E3 in person.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1024px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Team Nintendo Blast\"\n        title=\"Team Nintendo Blast\"\n        src=\"/static/98cc107e7213fa6b104251307e7d5c8a/63217/nintendo_blast_crew.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/98cc107e7213fa6b104251307e7d5c8a/db830/nintendo_blast_crew.jpg 256w,\n/static/98cc107e7213fa6b104251307e7d5c8a/8102f/nintendo_blast_crew.jpg 512w,\n/static/98cc107e7213fa6b104251307e7d5c8a/63217/nintendo_blast_crew.jpg 1024w,\n/static/98cc107e7213fa6b104251307e7d5c8a/d58d1/nintendo_blast_crew.jpg 1536w,\n/static/98cc107e7213fa6b104251307e7d5c8a/09658/nintendo_blast_crew.jpg 2048w,\n/static/98cc107e7213fa6b104251307e7d5c8a/49580/nintendo_blast_crew.jpg 3648w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span>\n    <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\">Team Nintendo Blast</figcaption>\n  </figure></p>\n<p>Let’s hope for an E3 come back in 2023 and see you there!</p>","fields":{"postHashId":"Z2FtZXN0cnVlbnVsbDIwMjItMDYtMDFUMDA6MDA6MDAuMDAwWg==","slug":"/2022/2022-06-01-10-years-anniversary-of-my-first-e3.en/","path":"/blog/games/10-years-anniversary-of-my-first-e3/","locale":"en"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["e3","e3 2012","games","los angeles","lacc","convention center","nintendo","sony","microsoft","gameblast","media","journalism"],"categories":["games"],"allowComments":true,"publishOnMedium":false,"cover":null,"date":"2022-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","id":null,"path":"10-years-anniversary-of-my-first-e3","show":true,"title":"10 years anniversary of my first E3","hideExcerpt":false,"subtitle":"10 years ago today I was embarking on a journey to my first E3 conference."}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>On Phaser 3 you can pre-load your assets in a function called <code class=\"language-text\">preload</code> so they are ready to use when the function <code class=\"language-text\">create</code> starts.

makes the Matrix source-code show up in the background of the website (try it now), which although is super cool, I was thinking it would be even cooler to make the Konami Code open a game or something, and since I already have 2 years of experience in Phaser, I decided to make a silly game just as an MVP.</p>\n<p>Around the same days, I found out about the <a href=\"https://github.com/Annoraaq/grid-engine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">grid-engine Phaser plugin</a> that makes it SO much easier to create a top-down RPG-like game, that I decided to make a game with it, and also because my first “programming” experience date backs to 2002 when I was creating games exactly like this with RPG Maker.</p>\n<p>From then on the project started to get a little more ambitious, and I thought “what if I show the blog posts in-game?”, all the blog data is available in React via <code class=\"language-text\">GraphQL</code> anyway, so it shouldn’t be too difficult.</p>\n<h2 id=\"using-react-as-ui-for-phaser\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#using-react-as-ui-for-phaser\" aria-label=\"using react as ui for phaser permalink\"

rendering pixels inside a <code class=\"language-text\">canvas</code> element in the DOM, and it’s great, but one of the great features of web development is the power of the DOM and CSS to create great UI elements, and you can’t do that with Phaser alone.</p>\n<p>The simplest way to use Phaser with React is with a functional component like the one below.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> React <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'react'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\r\n<span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> Phaser <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'phaser'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token function\">GameComponent</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\r\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> game <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Phaser<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>Game</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\r\n        <span class=\"token operator\">...</span>configs<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\r\n        <span class=\"token literal-property property\">parent</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'game-content'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\r\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\r\n\r\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>div id<span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token string\">\"game-content\"</span> <span class=\"token operator\">/</span><span class=\"token operator\">></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\r\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"token keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">default</span> GameComponent<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>And that works fine for most cases, but to make Phaser be able to communicate back and forth with React, like to show a menu item or a dialog box, I will dispatch JavaScript events between Phaser and React.</p>\n<p>The best way to do it would be with some sort of state management tool like <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/flux/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Flux</a>, but since this is just a very small project, dispatching JavaScript events will work for now.

<code class=\"language-text\">useEffect</code> to dynamically import all my Phaser-related modules, as <code class=\"language-text\">useEffect</code> is only executed on the client-side.</p>\n<div

rel=\"noreferrer\">their official documentation page</a>.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned before, to make collisions work automatically with a map created on Tiled, just add the property <code class=\"language-text\">ge_collide</code> set to <code class=\"language-text\">true</code> for the tiles the hero is supposed to collide with.</p>\n<p>Notice that this will make the hero move and collide with objects, but there is no walking animation. To create new sprite animations I will use the <code class=\"language-text\">this.anims.create()</code> function, and then play that animation every time the grid-engine tells me that the player moved, with the <code class=\"language-text\">movementStarted</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">movementStopped</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">directionChanged</code> events dispatched

great features of web development is the power of the DOM and CSS to create great UI elements, and you can’t do that with Phaser alone.</p>\n<p>The simplest way to use Phaser with React is with a

communicate back and forth with React, like to show a menu item or a dialog box, I will dispatch JavaScript events between Phaser and React.</p>\n<p>The best way to do it would be with some sort of state management tool like <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/flux/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Flux</a>, but since this is just a very small project, dispatching JavaScript events will work for now.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token comment\">// React

automatically with a map created on Tiled, just add the property <code class=\"language-text\">ge_collide</code> set to <code class=\"language-text\">true</code> for the tiles the hero is supposed to collide with.</p>\n<p>Notice that this will make the hero move and collide with objects, but there is no walking animation.

game.</p>\n<p>First I’m going to create an object using the <code class=\"language-text\">Phaser.GameObjects.Rectangle</code> class:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\"

simple and contains 3 props, an integer <code class=\"language-text\">screenWidth</code>, for the placement of the HUD on the screen, an integer <code class=\"language-text\">coins</code>, to show the amount of collected coins, and a <code class=\"language-text\">healthState</code> array, with the amount of hearts and whether they are empty, full or half.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\"

again I’m going to use Tiled’s object layer with a custom property named <code class=\"language-text\">teleportTo</code> with the value <code class=\"language-text\">mapKey:positionX:positionY</code>.</p>\n<p>But what about starting the same game scene that you’re already in? For that there is the <code class=\"language-text\">this.scene.restart()</code> function. So I’m going to create a custom collider to collide with the hero and teleport, add a fade-out, and pass all the hero and new map data to <code

If you press <code class=\"language-text\">ENTER</code>, it will finish the current message animation and show it in full and if you press <code class=\"language-text\">ENTER</code> again it will move to the next message if there is one.</p>\n<p>The two main changes in the code for the <code class=\"language-text\">Message.jsx</code> component are that the <code class=\"language-text\">useTransition</code> API changed to receive just the items and the config object, instead of the items, a mapping function, and the config object.</p>\n<p>I also added the <code class=\"language-text\">onRest</code> property to the <code class=\"language-text\">useTransition</code> config object to check if the message animation is over. <code class=\"language-text\">onRest</code> is called after every letter animation, so I need to check for the current letter index.</p>\n<p>If the prop <code class=\"language-text\">forceShowFullMessage</code> is sent, then I will simply show the full message, without any animation.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre

version of the <code class=\"language-text\">tileset</code>, so you make any changes to one of these, all other maps won’t be aware of it.</p>\n<p>I actually already talked about this one this blog <a href=\"/en/blog/games/loading-external-tileset-file-on-phaser-js-using-webpack-skate-platformer-game-devlog-7/\">one year ago, in my Game Devlog #7</a>, but that solution was to programmatically embed an external <code class=\"language-text\">tileset</code> into a map, today I will get a <code class=\"language-text\">tileset</code> that is already embedded in one map and copy it to all my other

create, because I needed some knowledge on basic circular motion physics, in which I had none 😅 and I wanted to be able to choose the speed and direction of the spin on Tiled.</p>\n<p>So I asked my girlfriend for help since she has a degree in engineer, but she knew so much, and I knew so little, that it was a hard conversation but in the end, I managed to do it with her help.</p>\n<p>The base rotation formulas are the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>radius = circleDiameter / 2</p>\n<p>secondsPerRotation = gravity / velocity</p>\n<p>angularSpeed = 360 / secondsPerRotation</p>\n<p>speed = (radius * (π * 2)) / secondsPerRotation</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The trick is to create a dummy object and set a spin on it with the <code class=\"language-text\">setAngularVelocity</code> function, then copy the velocity from the dummy object to the platform using the <code class=\"language-text\">velocityFromRotation</code> function.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\"

Those are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When the player steps on the platform, it will move up/down and then stop.</li>\n<li>If the player jumps and steps back into the platform, it will trigger the move again.</li>\n<li>If the platform is not at the same level as the player when the player approaches the platform, it should move to the player.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For that, I need one custom collider in the ground, that will trigger the platform to come down when it is up, a custom collider in the upper level to trigger the platform to go up when it is down, and an <code class=\"language-text\">update</code> function to determine if the platform should be triggered or not when the player is on top of it.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\"

But of course, you can probably print those with all types of printers or even use one of the various online 3D printing services available, like <a href=\"https://shapeways.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">shapeways</a>.</p>\n<p>I advise you to use different colored PLA for maximum awesomeness, but you can also print in one color and then paint it (or not). There are 20 files in total, and some of them you’ll need to print more than once, like <code class=\"language-text\">shield_triforce.stl</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">upper-handle.stl</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">sword_triforce.stl</code>. The <code class=\"language-text\">outer-shield.stl</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">inner-shield.stl</code> are the longest files to printing, taking me around 18 hours each.</p>\n<p>To glue everything together I used the Pattex Repair eXtreme, but any gel-like glue will do the job, just try to avoid super-glues because they leave a nasty white blur near the glued parts.</p>\n<p>You can get the models <strong><a href=\"https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4902406\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">on Thingiverse</a></strong>, and of course they’re free, as everything is property of Nintendo and I’m only creating this as a fun personal project under the <a href=\"https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0001886/2021-01-01\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">fair use of copyrighted material</a>.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;

it.</p>\n<p>But why not simply use those websites that mesh together <code class=\"language-text\">PNG</code> files into a sprite sheet? Well because Phaser not only needs the <code class=\"language-text\">PNG</code> sprite sheet, but also an atlas <code class=\"language-text\">JSON</code> file with all the sprite sheet details like frame name and dimensions.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 658px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 42.1875%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Assets by kenney.nl\"\n        title=\"Assets by kenney.nl\"\n        src=\"/static/8a32f26bd9206da785dc3795034528f5/e7930/hero-sprite-sheet.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/8a32f26bd9206da785dc3795034528f5/e3135/hero-sprite-sheet.png 256w,\n/static/8a32f26bd9206da785dc3795034528f5/06341/hero-sprite-sheet.png 512w,\n/static/8a32f26bd9206da785dc3795034528f5/e7930/hero-sprite-sheet.png 658w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span>\n    <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\">Assets by kenney.nl</figcaption>\n  </figure></p>\n<p>For this I’m going to use the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/free-tex-packer-core\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">free-tex-packer-core</a> package made by <a href=\"https://github.com/odrick\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">odrick</a>.

I’m really happy I managed to do this devlog, after all Cyberpunk 2077 was released this week, and I’m playing it on Stadia! Today’s devlog is long mostly because I want to explain the reason why I am doing things a certain way.</p>\n<p>Today I’m going to show you how I improved my enemy AI and why I handle so many edge cases in my code. Let’s dive into it.</p>\n<p><div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.42857142857143%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <div class=\"embedVideo-container\"> <iframe title=\"\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KoCubm17q8s?rel=0\" class=\"embedVideo-iframe\" style=\"border:0; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \" loading=\"eager\" allowfullscreen=\"\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"></iframe> </div> </div></p>\n<p>My first take on the AI algorithm was to calculate it on the go, so wherever I place an enemy, it would move around and calculate if it should turn or not on every frame, this was very costly, especially when I had many enemies on screen.</p>\n<p>There were two ways to approach this problem, one would be manually creating a static path on Tiled and make the enemy follow that path, but whenever I add a new enemy, I would have to add a path for it too, and this can get really annoying to do really fast.</p>\n<p>The second option is instead of calculating the enemy’s behavior on every frame, I could pre-calculate all of them as soon as the stage is loaded and then set that path statically, this way I would have the freedom to add enemies wherever I want on Tiled, without having to add extra paths for them to follow and also keep the framerate stable by not processing the enemy’s logic on every frame.</p>\n<p>So how did I do that? First, there are some edge cases that I needed to handle, like what if the enemy is not on a platform? Or what if the platform doesn’t have edges? I know I will be making the stages on Tiled, but it’s good to handle those anyway because we never know.</p>\n<p>Since I can’t know if the enemy is already on a platform or not, I need to wait for the game’s physics to kick in and calculate the enemy’s position, such as gravity and stuff, so instead of calculating the static AI in the <code class=\"language-text\">constructor</code>, I’m doing it in the <code class=\"language-text\">update</code> function, and after it’s calculated, I simply “remove” the <code class=\"language-text\">update</code> function by replacing it with a <code

that afterward I can simply create a stage on Tiled and everything works without having to mess around with it, creating colliders and other things manually, just like how Breath of The Wild was made. I much rather that the game calculate it all for me, so I can focus on creating levels. In the end, I’ll have something like a Mario Maker 😃.</p>\n<p>And that was all for today, thanks for reading and watching the video, and don’t forget to leave your comment about what you are thinking about this series of posts/videos.

class=\"language-text\">.json</code> file uploaded by the user and make it available on Phaser’s “cached file manager”, and the best way to do that is by using Phaser’s <code

Another way to do that would be by running <code class=\"language-text\">Object.assign(this, { someExternalFunction })</code> inside the constructor, and then call the function as if it was a class method, like <code class=\"language-text\">this.someExternalFunction()</code>, then you don’t need to bind it.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token function\">update</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">time<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> delta</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\r\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span><span class=\"token function\">platformWalkingBehavior</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\r\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>For the logic inside <code class=\"language-text\">platformWalkingBehavior</code>, I did it in the simplest way possible, but I still need to improve it for efficiency when many enemies are on the screen.

Then I also check if there’s any collidable tile right in front of the enemy, if it does, it means the enemy must turn and walk in the other direction.

We didn't really plan in naming the game now, but the idea simply popped into our heads and we think the name is perfect. Let me ask you this, what's the skater's worst enemy? Unarguably those small pebbles, right? What if in the future there's an evil company that wants to prohibit skateboarding everywhere, what would that company be called? Pebble Corp of course.

This is quite frustrating because whenever you make changes to your tileset, you will have to go to all your map files and re-embed the tileset, this can be very time-consuming if you have multiple maps and tilesets.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left:

Claro que eu já sou um gamer que compra mais do que consome, mas dessa vez o problema não era esse, e sim onde jogar mesmo. Eu tenho um Game Boy Advance SP, é o melhor jeito de se jogar GBA hoje em dia, só que eu não consigo me acostumar com o jeito que ele é, em “portrait”, os meus dedos se encontram na parte de trás do console, tirando que ele parece um estojo de maquiagem, na verdade eu nunca gostei muito desse designe de “flip”, até mesmo nos celulares. Só que não adianta jogar GBA no Game Boy Advance Classic porque você não enxerga nada! É incrível como existiu uma leva de portáteis que não tem luz própria. Agora que já expliquei o meu problema, vamos para a solução: Por sorte minha, ano passado a galera do K-Team lançou um console baseado no hardware do GBA chamado <a href=\"http://revok101.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Revo K101</a>, que é basicamente o hardware do Game Boy Advance dentro da case de um <a href=\"http://dx.com/p/gemei-a330-3-0-lcd-mp3-mp4-media-games-player-with-fm-tv-out-sd-white-4gb-47741\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Gemei A330</a>, o que é perfeito, pois tem o design bem parecido com o Game Boy Advance Classic, tipo “landscape” e tem a backlight. Uhuuul! Mas isso não é tudo, esse console tem diversas vantagens, como TV Out, possibilidade de trocar de bateria e também ele já acompanha um Flash Card que roda nativamente NES, SNES, GB, GBC e mais alguns outros consoles. Fiz um unboxing dele, segue ai o vídeo:</p>\n<p><div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.42857142857143%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <div class=\"embedVideo-container\"> <iframe title=\"\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QopGTeq46Sk?rel=0\" class=\"embedVideo-iframe\" style=\"border:0; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \" loading=\"eager\" allowfullscreen=\"\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"></iframe> </div> </div></p>\n<p>Eu aconselho muito a comprar esse console se você ainda curte jogar os jogos de GBA.

Hardly.</p>\n<p>It just arrived at a time when I can’t help but post about what’s coming next week.</p>\n<p>Well, last year I had the great opportunity to go to Comic Con in San Diego as a press, I did all the rush to register, I sent them a letter and after a month of waiting I had my press ticket confirmed. Unfortunately, due to several unforeseen events, I was unable to travel and missed this great opportunity.</p>\n<p>Of course, the dream would be to be able to go to E3, which unfortunately was not possible (and not even planned) due to the date that coincides with the dates of my college exams, and also coincided with the presentation of my CBT. Last year’s E3 was very epic, especially the part of Nintendo’s conference (which I won’t be attending this year …), not only for the conference itself, but for the adventure I went through to attend it, it happened that the internet went down well in the middle of the presentation, which made me and my fellow Nintendista Luca have to run out of the house, get a ride to go to someone else’s house to watch the conference, and well, we did it. Everything worked out in the end.</p>\n<p>Why won’t I attend the Nintendo conference? Well, it’s simple. After years of wishing, my presence at E3 is confirmed, I will be part of the <a href=\"https://www.nintendoblast.com.br/2012/05/e3-2012-nintendo-blast-fara-cobertura.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nintendo Blast team</a> that will cover the event.</p>\n<p>We were divided into two groups: Those who will attend the conference live and those who stayed at the event, covering what happens while the conference is going on, and I was in the group that will stay at the event, which is extremely AWESOME, but I will miss watch and learn first hand what Nintendo has to say for its future releases.</p>\n<p>So many things that I could have done posts about events that happened recently, like a lot of knowledge about Magento that I acquired in the last two years, and I also never posted the programming tutorials for cell phones. Well, now Symbian is also a dead OS, who knows, I may not reuse this idea for something broader and more current, like Android.</p>\n<p>What really matters is: FUCK YEAH I’M GOING TO E3!

Go","hideExcerpt":false,"subtitle":""}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>Well, it is been a few months since I decided to dedicate a few days of my life trying to put Zelda games on a correct timeline.</p>\n<p>I was based on the history of the games and the comments of the developers and until I was doing well, taking out some basic problems, like the fact that the first Princess Zelda that existed appeared in Adventure of Link.</p>\n<p>Things like that make things more complicated, because after all if in Ocarina of Time is where Ganon is born, and in Legend of Zelda there is already Ganon, Ocarina of Time comes before Legend of Zelda and Adventure of Link, soon this Princess Zelda who is asleep in Adventure of Link has been sleeping for centuries.</p>\n<p>This aside from the fact most declared by everyone who creates the timeline: Ocarina of Time is the first on the timeline. Much like Miyamoto once said “Ocarina of Time is the very first story!“. It turns out that we recently discovered that it is not quite like that: During this year’s E3, Skyward Sword, the new game in the Zelda series for Wii, was revealed.</p>\n<p>What happens is that in this game it is revealed how the Master Sword becomes Master Sword, and seeing that the Master Sword already existed in the Ocarina of Time, obviously Skyward Sword comes from all Zeldas. Which made it all very problematic, as I spent hours and hours putting the timeline together, and often some stories made perfect sense to stay before Ocarina of Time, but I couldn’t because of the simple fact that Ocarina of Time was the first Zelda , well, no more.</p>\n<p>At least Skyward Sword arrived already explaining A LOT, even with so little revealed. The fact that Skyward Sword can become Master Sword explains perfectly why Picori Sword and Lokomo Sword look so much like Master Sword - Somehow Master Sword ends up becoming Picori / Lokomo Sword.</p>\n<p>As few details were revealed about Skyward Sword, I prefer not to think about the timeline for now, even though despite explaining some things, Skyward Sword brought much more doubts than clarity.</p>\n<p>So I’m releasing below the post I intended to do on Zelda’s timeline. Get ready for a huge <a href=\"http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Wall_of_Text\" title=\"Wall of Text\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">WOT</a>!</p>\n<p>After researching A LOT, I completed my vision on Zelda’s timeline. I know that many have already done the same, including the GameTrailer website, but with each game released, gaps in these theories are created.</p>\n<p>I’m going to show you my own theory about Zelda’s timeline, of all the Zeldas I’ve played and everything I’ve studied about, I’m satisfied with this being the “official” timeline for me. First of all, one thing we need to understand is that Hyrule is not the name of a world, as ours is Earth.</p>\n<p>It is just a continent of a world that has not yet been revealed, just as Labrynna and Holodrum from Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons are continents in the same way. Another important thing is to know that the game’s hero name is not necessarily Link, so much so that you can choose the name every game start.</p>\n<p>Right then, the first thing we know about the Zelda universe, is the creation of Hyrule by the three Goddesses, Din, Nayru and Farore (In the act of creating the world of Hyrule, multiple universes were created).</p>\n<p>Then there was the great war in Hyrule, known as the Hyrulean Civil War to see who had the power of the Triforce, the war ended with the Triforce in the hands of the Royal Family of Hyrule, thus beginning the events of Ocarina of Time.</p>\n<p>Despite Aonuma’s hasty announcement about Four Swords for GBA, in which he claims that this game is the first on Zelda’s timeline, I rely more on the quotes in which he really was part of the game’s story development, not as a producer, like he was on Four Swords. After the events in Ocarina of Time, we have the famous split timeline, in which one Link goes back in time and tells Princess Zelda everything about Ganondorf and his plans, and in the other he continues in the future devastated by Ganondorf’s power.</p>\n<p>We will now continue with the timeline in which Link would remain an adult. After the world was destroyed by Ganondorf, the events mentioned in the backstory of Wind Waker occur: The king and the people of Hyrule asked the Gods to flood the world, afraid of the evil power of Ganon, who somehow resurrected and for some reason. reason was not prevented by Link.</p>\n<p>I don’t know this story will turn out to be some Zelda game, but I’ll leave a question at that point. Hundreds of years have passed and a new Link is born, he receives an outfit from his grandmother on his birthday, as a ritual of waiting for the hero to return from the past. These are the events of Wind Waker. This Link meets a pirate named Tetra who later reveals himself to be the reincarnation of the princess of Hyrule, Zelda and the King of Red Lions is revealed to be the former king who flooded Hyrule, Daphnes Nohansen Hyrule.</p>\n<p>After collecting the pieces of the Triforce of Courage and killing Ganondorf, Zelda and Link are given the mission to seek a new land to rule. Link and Tetra go in search of new lands, and are faced with a ghost ship, causing the events of Phantom Hourglass, where Link wakes up in an unknown land and Tetra is missing. Determined to find Tetra, Link goes on yet another adventure, where in the end it is revealed that Link was not in his world, but in the World of the Ocean King.</p>\n<p>Upon returning to their own world, the sailors on Tetra’s ship claim that the two were unconscious on the fanstasma ship for just 10 minutes, so Link looks in his pocket and finds the Phantom Hourglass. An adventure in a parallel universe or just a dream?</p>\n<p>It doesn’t really matter, as Spirit Tracks events follow. Many quotes in the game itself show that this new realm was found by Link and Zelda’s ancestors, who named it Hyrule, because of the old realm forgotten by people. One weird thing about Spirit Tracks is the Lokomo Sword, which was designed by the Gods to humans to defeat the bad in the past. She has an incredible resemblance to the Master Sword. Would it be itself with a different name, or does each land have its own weapon to fight evil?</p>\n<p>This remains open, everyone thinks what they want. Now, after Spirit Tracks, not much is known, so I’m going to fit a game that starts in a game that doesn’t know much about the past: Minish Cap. But between Minish Cap and Spirit Tracks I would like to put the future Zelda for Wii.</p>\n<p>Not that much is already known about the game, but what everything indicates is that it will be a game that will show a lot about Master Sword, and perhaps explain the Master Sword / Picori Sword transition. In Minish Cap, a new villain appears: Vaati.</p>\n<p>A sorcerer who only wants to become more powerful, and for that he needs the “Light Power” (triforce of wisdom?) That Princess Zelda has. Link once again has the mission to save Princess Zelda and on the way to his adventure, he forges the Four Sword and defeats Vaati.</p>\n<p>Since this Zelda doesn’t comment on Triforce or Ganon, the only thing we can imagine is that it is hundreds of years after Spirit Tracks, but one thing is certain: Minish have always existed. In a quote from the game, it says that the Minish have fun hiding items and breaks under rocks and grass around the world. After Minish Cap, obviously comes the Game Boy Advance’s Four Swords, in which Vaati manages to escape his prison and kidnaps Princess Zelda. Link goes after it to rescue Zelda and reseals Vaati on the Four Sword.</p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter comes the Four Swords Adventures, for Game Cube, in which Vaati is released again and at the end of the game it is revealed that Vaati was just being manipulated by Ganon, Link defeats Vaati and Ganon and saddles Ganon on the Four Sword. Here ends the timeline of the adult link for Ocarina of Time. Now let’s go back to the beginning of everything: Ocarina of Time’s Link goes back in time and tells Princess Zelda everything about Ganondorf and his plans and Ganondorf is sentenced to death.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Link says goodbye to Zelda as he goes in search of his companion Navi, who left him at the end of Ocarina of Time. While looking for Navi, Link gets lost in Lost Woods and is approached by a Skull Kid, who steals his Ocarina of Time and Epona, while following him, Link is teleported to another world, a universe parallel to Hyrule. Once there, Link learns that the moon is about to fall, and Link has only three days to stop the moon.</p>\n<p>At the end of the third day, Link uses the Ocarina of Time to go back in time and continue his adventure. At the end of the game, it is not very clear whether or not Link returns to Hyrule, but there are theories that he appears in the Twilight Princess in the form of Stalfo, I will talk about this later.</p>\n<p>Returning to the timeline, a while passed by Ocarina of Time and a tribe of dark magicians known as Dark Interlopers tried to get the Triforce using the power of the Fused Shadow but were stopped by the Light Spirits. Again, I don’t know if there will be a Zelda based on this story, so I’ll leave a question here. Hundreds of years later, the events of Twilight Princess take place, in which Ganondorf tries to dominate Hyrule again, but this time manipulating Zant, a being of the Twilight Realm, which I also believe to be the Dark World, as well as many.</p>\n<p>After defeating Zant, Link battles Ganondorf and defeats him with the Master Sword. After the events of Twilight Princess, many hundreds of years pass, and for some reason, Triforce is separated into several pieces. After the events of Twilight Princess, the A Link to The Past begins, in which the Imprisoning War is introduced, which is not known for sure if the events occurred in Twilight Princess or Ocarina of Time. Link to the Past begins on a night when Link wakes up to the telepathic cry for help made by Zelda, who tries to call someone to her rescue, upon hearing the words Link’s Uncle takes his shield and sword and goes after it to rescue the Princess. Link gets up from his bed and goes after his uncle, to try to help him.</p>\n<p>Ahead, again Zelda helps Link enter the castle by revealing a hidden passage that was in the corner gardens, going there, Link finds his uncle lying on the floor, he asks him to help Zelda to free himself from the wizard Agahnim. Zelda and Link then meet and go to a secret room, arriving there with a priest who tells Link that to end the chaos created by Agahnim, Link needs to recover the Master Sword that is hidden in Lost Woods.</p>\n<p>After going through one of the most difficult adventures of all Zelda games, Link and Zelda defeat Ganon, who planned to escape the Dark World, manipulating the wizard Agahnim to release him from his seal, Ganon is sealed again, along with the Dark world. After the events of Link to the Past, for some reason Link is absent from Hyrule, and Ganon manages to break free from the Dark World, it is not explained very well how. A new hero, who is not Link appears, is the “Hero of the Light” in which he can be chosen as a man or woman at the beginning of the game.</p>\n<p>The story takes place in 4 weeks, in the first week the hero wakes up in one of the houses of A Link to the Past and is given the task of rescuing Princess Zelda. Over the course of the four weeks, the hero learns more about Ganon and Link and how he should stop Ganon. In the fourth week the hero defeats Ganon, places the Master Sword where it belongs and is teleported back to where it belongs. Many years later, a new Link appears and has the mission to stop Ganon’s actions again, these are the events that took place in the first Legend of Zelda, which as Miyamoto himself said, A Link to the Past are the ancestors of Link and Zelda of the first Legend of Zelda.</p>\n<p>After gathering the 8 pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom and defeating Ganon, the Adventure of Link events begin, where he is summoned for another mission by Impa. It reveals to Link that many generations ago, there was a kingdom where a king reigned with justice and wisdom using the power of the Triforce. This king hid a part of the Triforce, the Triforce of Courage, and reported the secret location only to his daughter Zelda.</p>\n<p>When the king passed away, his son wanted to know the location of the Triforce, but his sister Zelda did not want to reveal it, so he sent a witch to use a spell to force his sister to reveal the location of the Triforce, and was unsuccessful. Then the witch cast a spell on Princess Zelda that put her to sleep. Terrified by the tragedy, the prince ordered that from that generation, all the princesses of Hyrule should be called Zelda.</p>\n<p>This was a very important event, which is very different from the Wind Waker timeline, in which we have Tetra. Returning to Adventure of Link, after Link restored the Triforce of Courage and woke up Princess Zelda, she is kidnapped by dragons and begins the Game &#x26; Watch Zelda.</p>\n<p>Many disregard this game, but it is an official Nintendo release and should not be disregarded. After providing many services of the Royal Family and saving Hyrule, Triforce summons Link and sends him to a distant kingdom that needs help.</p>\n<p>Then the Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages events begin. When one of the two games is finished and you start the second game with the code given at the end of the first, the true story of the game is revealed. At the end of the game (if you started with the code after finishing the other one) it is revealed that Zelda had been captured by Ganondorf’s mothers due to trying to resuscitate Ganon.</p>\n<p>At the end of the game Link defeats Ganon and goes out on a raft back to his homeland, Hyrule. But a storm causes him to get lost, and ends up stopping on Koholint Island. Link learns that to leave this island, he first needs to wake up Wind Fish, and upon waking him up, Link discovers that the island he was on was just a creation of a Wind Fish dream, the game is over and it is not clear whether Link made it home or not.</p>\n<p>After Link’s Awakening, many years have passed and A Link to the Past events begin. I know it’s almost official that Link’s Awakening is a sequel to A Link to the Past, but there were also a lot of mistakes in translating from Japanese to English, but it wouldn’t be possible to put Link to the Past as the protagonist of Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons for the simple fact that in Oracle of Age / Seasons you eliminate Ganon, and following A Link to The Past, where Link is not the hero but “The Hero of Light”, Ganon is also defeated , making this connection impossible, as there would be two Ganons at the same time in different lands.</p>\n<p>Yeah, quite a lot! I guarantee you that this placement there, even before the Skyward Sword announcement was the one that made the most sense, despite some small inconsistencies, but that could be fixed with perhaps some other game between the stories.</p>\n<p>I will do the timeline again, we just need to know a little more about the Skyward Sword story. Until then, we only have … I don’t know, keep thinking until the brain burns !!!</p>","fields":{"postHashId":"Z2FtZXN0cnVlLi4vLi4vY292ZXJzLzIwMTAvcG9zdC1pZC0yMTc0LWNvdmVyLnBuZzIwMTAtMDctMDNUMDA6MDA6MDAuMDAwWg==","slug":"/2010/2010-07-03-zelda-timeline-and-skyward-sword-placement.en/","path":"/blog/games/zelda-timeline-and-skyward-sword-placement/","locale":"en"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["skyward sword","timeline","zelda","games","general"],"categories":["games"],"allowComments":true,"publishOnMedium":false,"cover":"../../covers/2010/post-id-2174-cover.png","date":"2010-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","id":2174,"path":"zelda-timeline-and-skyward-sword-placement","show":true,"title":"Zelda timeline and Skyward Sword placement","hideExcerpt":false,"subtitle":""}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 743px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Jirachi Release\"\n        title=\"Jirachi Release\"\n        src=\"/static/0187b12215dd75d9c1d740b948acae5b/54571/jirachi-release.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/0187b12215dd75d9c1d740b948acae5b/db830/jirachi-release.jpg 256w,\n/static/0187b12215dd75d9c1d740b948acae5b/8102f/jirachi-release.jpg 512w,\n/static/0187b12215dd75d9c1d740b948acae5b/54571/jirachi-release.jpg 743w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 743px) 100vw, 743px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span>\n    <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\">Jirachi Release</figcaption>\n  </figure></p>\n<p>As you may already know, a special Jirachi distribution event took place in Brazil, organized by Latamel. It was beautiful, I went to the penultimate day of distribution, at Saraiva Mega Store in New York City Center - Rio de Janeiro. Once there, countless Pokémon fans talking, battling, exchanging Pokémon - The place was filled with Nintendo fans. I became friends with people there, we played a few games of Mario Kart DS while we waited for the Jirachi distributor to come back from lunch. As soon as he returned, I started turning on my DSi to get Jirachi! It was really cool !!!</p>\n<p>I had the opportunity to speak with the Jirachi distributor, Diego. He explained that the starting point for this event to happen was Nintendo’s contact with Latamel. That’s right !! Nintendo has an eye on Brazil, interested in doing events, and as this was a success, more are yet to come! LET’S GO!

Yes, I’m going to talk about a really discussed subject that exists on any forum/blog/fotolog/twitter/bar/museum/school on the world: The timeline of <a href=\"http://zelda.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zelda</a> . Is there really one? Why does <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigeru_Miyamoto\" title=\"Shigeru Miyamoto on Wikipédia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> loves to do those mind blower s that lets everybody INSANE? If you lost your hopes trying to find a correct timeline for <a href=\"http://zelda.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zelda</a>, I hope that this post will put you back on track in the way of hope and that one day we’ll understand the universe of <a href=\"http://zelda.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zelda</a> and its timeline.</p>\n<p>To start, watch this video:</p>\n<p><div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.42857142857143%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <div class=\"embedVideo-container\"> <iframe title=\"\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/F2g65jL3HDg?rel=0\" class=\"embedVideo-iframe\" style=\"border:0; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \" loading=\"eager\" allowfullscreen=\"\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"></iframe> </div> </div></p>\n<p>Now that you’re finished you must be thinking: “WOW, AWSOME!”, just like me and others. Some months after this new theory’s been created, the video’s author sent it to <a href=\"http://nintendo.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nintendo</a>, asking if he got any close to a solution to the timeline of <a href=\"http://zelda.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zelda</a>, and <a href=\"http://nintendo.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nintendo</a> answered this:Resuming: are we screwed? No, not at all. What happened here?</p>\n<p>Someone really addicted to <a href=\"http://zelda.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zelda</a> searched a little bit, was able to make lots of connections between <a href=\"http://zelda.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zelda</a> games and made this really famous video on <a href=\"http://youtube.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">YouTube</a>, and when he got in contact with <a href=\"http://nintendo.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nintendo</a>, got the response that there was no timeline on <a href=\"http://zelda.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zelda</a>.</p>\n<p>Well, I was really upset with <a href=\"http://nintendo.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nintendo’s</a> response, and resolved to e-mail them. I wrote about the contact between <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/ocarinahero10\" title=\"ocarinahero10 on YouTube\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ocarinahero10</a> and its videos, I talked about what <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigeru_Miyamoto\" title=\"Shigeru Miyamoto on Wikipédia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Miyamoto</a> himself said once, that there are two timelines on <a href=\"http://zelda.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zelda</a> and even quote the <a href=\"http://zelda.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeldas</a> that have official sequences ( <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda_(video_game)\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zelda</a> -> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelda_II:_The_Adventure_of_Link\" title=\"Zelda II on Wikipédia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zelda II</a> ; <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocarina_of_Time\" title=\"Ocarina of Time on Wikipédia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ocarina of Time</a> -> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Majora&#x27;s_Mask\" title=\"Majora&#x27;s Mask on Wikipédia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Majora’s Mask</a> ; <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_Waker\" title=\"Wind Waker on Wikipédia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Wind Waker</a> -> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_Hourglass\" title=\"Phantom Hourglass on Wikipédia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Phantom Hourglass</a> ; <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_of_Seasons\" title=\"Oracle of Seasons on Wikipédia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Oracle of Seasons</a> -> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_of_Ages\" title=\"Oracle of Ages on Wikipédia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Oracle of Ages</a> ), and here’s the answer of <a href=\"http://nintendo.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nintendo</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hello Pablo,</p>\n<p>Since the first Legend of Zelda game was released on the NES years ago, fans of the series have tried to fit each game into a timeline, each game representing a separate episode of Link’s life. This has lead to much speculation and discussion, particularly over the games where Link switches between adult and young boy.</p>\n<p>The 2003 release of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker finally put an end to the speculation and discussion in its opening line, “This is but one of the legends of which people speak…” The basic assumption has always been that Link is a single individual. However, in an interview given at the time it was released, the game’s director, Eiji Aonuma (speaking for himself and Shigeru Miyamoto, the original creator of the series) stated “In our opinions, with the Legend of Zelda, every game has a new Link. A new hero named Link always rises to fight evil.”</p>\n<p>This means that–unless otherwise specified–each new game represents a new Link and that there isn’t a true frame of reference or timeline possible for the series. For additional information on The Legend of Zelda series, please visit our official Legend of Zelda website at the following address:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.zelda.com/universe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">www.zelda.com/universe/</a></p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Sharon Matheny</p>\n<p>Nintendo of America Inc.</p>\n<p>Nintendo’s home page: <a href=\"http://www.nintendo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.nintendo.com/</a></p>\n<p>Power Line (Automated Product Info): (425) 885-7529</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Uhmn, wait a minute… I’ve seen that response somewhere… right! I got the same response that on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/ocarinahero10\" title=\"ocarinahero10 on YouTube\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ocarinahero10</a>, but what does this means? It means that <a href=\"http://nintendo.com/\" title=\"official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nintendo’s</a> website has a system that identifies the words “Zelda” and “timeline” and doesn’t even bother to read what you say, and send you that automatic e-mail. Kind of boring, right? So I give it a GOOD look on the internet about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigeru_Miyamoto\" title=\"Shigeru Miyamoto on Wikipédia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Miyamoto</a> saying that there is a chronological sequence on <a href=\"http://zelda.com/\" title=\"official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zelda</a>, and I did find it, here it is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigeru_Miyamoto\" title=\"Shigeru Miyamoto on Wikipédia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Miyamoto’s</a> statement:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Ocarina of Time is the first story, then the original Legend of Zelda, then Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, and finally A Link to the Past. It’s not very clear where Link’s Awakening fits in–it could be anytime after Ocarina of Time.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And his one from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiji_Aonuma\" title=\"Eiji Aonuma on Wikipédia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Eiji Aonuma</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“As for the timeline, Twilight Princess is set several hundred years after Link has fought Ganondorf in Ocarina of Time and returned to his own time (the OoT ending), and becomes a parallel world to The Wind Waker (the time axis originally splits in Ocarina of Time and a parallel timeline is formed). Wind Waker begins several hundred years immediately after adult Link seals away Ganondorf, Twilight Princess occurs several hundred years after the adult Link is sent back to his original time by Zelda’s power.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Two powerful quotes spoken by who’s behind the game, which proves that <a href=\"http://zelda.com/\" title=\"official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zelda</a> HAS a timeline =D And now that you’re finishing reading this post, you’re very happy hearing such news, but there is one problem: sources.</p>\n<p>All sources of those information, were took from blogs and websites about <a href=\"http://zelda.com/\" title=\"official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zelda</a>, so how can we tell they’re true? Well, I searched a little bit about the sources, I spent like 5 hours searching where the first quote was from, and I found out that it came from an exclusive interview with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigeru_Miyamoto\" title=\"Shigeru Miyamoto on Wikipédia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Miyamoto</a> to a magazine called <a href=\"http://nintendopower.com/\" title=\"official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nintendo Power</a> in November of 1998, <a href=\"http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/111998.shtml\" title=\"miyamotoshrine.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>click here</strong></a> to read it.</p>\n<p>This interview was published on January of 1999 in a special edition of <a href=\"http://nintendopower.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nintendo Power</a> #116, the edition that only who have a subscription of the magazine gets it. I searched on eBay for that special edition but I didn’t find it =( So I e-mailed <a href=\"http://nintendopower.com/\" title=\"official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nintendo Power</a> and <a href=\"http://nintendo.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nintendo</a> with the link of the interview, asking if it’s really true, and they answered yes!</p>\n<p>So the first quote about Ocarina of Time being the first <a href=\"http://zelda.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zelda</a> ever it’s true and was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigeru_Miyamoto\" title=\"Shigeru Miyamoto on Wikipédia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Miyamoto</a> himself who said it =D The source of the second quote was a lot easier to find, I searched on the official website of <a href=\"http://www.nindori.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nintendo Dream</a>, japanese magazine of <a href=\"http://nintendo.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nintendo</a>, and I found the edition that has that quote, to access the interview (in japanese) <a href=\"http://www.nindori.com/interview/154zelda/154int_02.html\" title=\"Nintendo Dream\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>click here</strong></a>, and to see the translation (english by <a href=\"http://translate.google.com/translate_t?hl=pt-br#\" title=\"Tradutor da Google\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Google translator</a> ) <a href=\"http://translate.google.com.br/translate?hl=pt-BR&#x26;sl=ja&#x26;tl=en&#x26;u=http://www.nindori.com/interview/154zelda/154int_02.html\" title=\"Nintendo Dream\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>You can also check the translated version by Patricia and TSA, from <a href=\"http://www.thehylia.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">thehylia.com/</a> by <a href=\"http://www.thehylia.com/index.php?subaction=showfull&#x26;id=1173582355\" title=\"Translation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>clicking here</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>There, job done!

But to get the inner works, only with time!</p>\n<p>I spent almost a month playing several hours with <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote</a> a bunch of games that I have on my <a href=\"http://www.nokia.com.br/A4799272\" title=\"Nokia E51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nokia E51</a> and I’ll make a review talking about the pros and cons of <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote</a>. Soon as I grabbed my Zeemote, I had a little problem: Batteries. Well, two AAA batteries are a problem, they’re expensive and don’t last long, but with time, I’ve realised that they last a lot with <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote</a>, but is always better to buy rechargeable batteries.</p>\n<p>To synchronize <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote</a> with your cellphone is a really simple process, you have to install <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote’s</a> software ( <a href=\"http://www.zeemote.com/zeekey/\" title=\"Zeekey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeekey</a> ), which has Portuguese language, and in it you’ll have a simple step-by-step explaining how to connect <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote</a> on your device. After you connect it, let’s go to the configs: You can create lots of different profiles, each one of them with its own key mapping personalized to the game you want to play. After the key mapping is done, you just have to select the profile you want to use and let <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote</a> running in background: You’re now free to run any game you want to. When the game started, I got surprised: <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote’s</a> response is unbelievably fast, without any delay, it’s just great!</p>\n<p>I spent 20 minutes playing and I admit that at beginning was a little bit difficult to get used to <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote</a>, but as time passed, and after a lot of key re-mapping, I got to the perfect configs. Despite the fast response, bluetooth is not a really fast network, so what happened to me was that <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote’s</a> response friezed for a second and didn’t answer my commands, but as I was with my cellphone in the other hand, I kept playing with it, and within a second <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote</a> was good to go again.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately that happened a few times and messes up your game, specially in a crucial part when a lot of commands are sent at the same time, but I believe that this problem can be resolved in the next versions of <a href=\"http://www.zeemote.com/zeekey/\" title=\"Zeekey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeekey</a>. Another problem that I found was because of the games themselves: Companies don’t create games thinking in <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote</a> (obviously), so some commands, like to move your character diagonally, are not 100% understood by the game itself, which leaves the movement kind of confuse. I don’t know if you can implement an improvement on <a href=\"http://www.zeemote.com/zeekey/\" title=\"Zeekey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeekey</a> about this problem, sadly.</p>\n<p>Two AAA batteries last quite a long time on <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote</a>, in this month that I’ve used it I didn’t have to change them not even once, and I played quite a long time, I carried <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote</a> everywhere. Well, that was kind of a con, I was thinking: To carry <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote</a> from here to there all the time. Who wants to walk with a joystick in their pocket? There you think “that’s a problem”.</p>\n<p>I spent the first few days carrying it in my pocket, and then I got used to it and now I can say that it didn’t bother me at all, actually <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote</a> is now part of my key chain. It’s light and quite small, practically the size of those first Sony MP3 players. My experience with <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote</a> in the last month was really good and I believe it’s only going to get better. Well, if you consider yourself addicted in video games, buy a Zeemote. Is there a better thing than play <a href=\"http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_mario_world\" title=\"SMW no Wikipédia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Super Mario World</a> in some boring class? 😅</p>\n<p>Like in every good review, I have to give it a score, so there it goes: 8.0.</p>\n<h2 id=\"final-score-80\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#final-score-80\" aria-label=\"final score 80 permalink\" class=\"post-headers-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Final score: 8.0</h2>\n<p>The videos below show myself playing some games with <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote</a>, you can see that its response is great.</p>\n<p><strong>Resident Evil: Degeneration</strong>:</p>\n<p><div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.42857142857143%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <div class=\"embedVideo-container\"> <iframe title=\"\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DJpPclrP6jc?rel=0\" class=\"embedVideo-iframe\" style=\"border:0; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \" loading=\"eager\" allowfullscreen=\"\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"></iframe> </div> </div></p>\n<p><strong>Crash Bandicoot Nitro Kart 3D</strong>:</p>\n<p><div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.42857142857143%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <div class=\"embedVideo-container\"> <iframe title=\"\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/M5Gog73K-SI?rel=0\" class=\"embedVideo-iframe\" style=\"border:0; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \" loading=\"eager\" allowfullscreen=\"\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"></iframe> </div> </div></p>","fields":{"postHashId":"Z2FkZ2V0c3RydWUuLi8uLi9jb3ZlcnMvMjAwOS9wb3N0LWlkLTc4OS1jb3Zlci5wbmcyMDA5LTA2LTEwVDAwOjAwOjAwLjAwMFo=","slug":"/2009/2009-06-10-review-zeemote-js1.en/","path":"/blog/gadgets/review-zeemote-js1/","locale":"en"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["nokia","zeemote js1","zeemote","cellphones","games","hardware","review"],"categories":["gadgets"],"allowComments":true,"publishOnMedium":false,"cover":"../../covers/2009/post-id-789-cover.png","date":"2009-06-10T00:00:00.000Z","id":789,"path":"review-zeemote-js1","show":true,"title":"Review: Zeemote JS1","hideExcerpt":false,"subtitle":""}}}],"ogImage":"/static/0e93743a85e03fab3fe678df24268bce/63217/e3_selfie.jpg","language":"en","intl":{"language":"en","languages":["en","pt-br"],"messages":{"site_title":"pablo.gg","title":"Title","author":"@thepiratepablo","search_placeholder":"Search...","about":"About","photos":"Photos","archive":"Archive","contact":"Contact","close":"Close","contact_page":"Contact page","see_more":"See more posts","built_with":"Built with ","buy_me_a_soda":"Buy me a soda","blog":"Blog","blog_posts":"Blog posts","go_to_post":"Go to post","search":"Search","loading":"Loading...","search_results":"Search results","search_results_for":"{quantity} search results for: \"{query}\"","search_for_query":"Search for \"{query}\"","no_results":"No results","home":"Home","description":"Yet another developer personal blog","go_back":"Go back to the homepage","thats_me":"That's me!","got_it":"Got it!","check_it_out":"Check it out!","we_are":"We are","e3":"E3","away_from_next_sgf":"away from Summer Game Fest 2025","away_from_next_gamescom":"away from Gamescom 2024","sgf_countdown":"Summer Game Fest Countdown","gamescom_countdown":"Gamescom Countdown","e3_paragraph_1":"This page once featured a countdown to the next E3 event, a moment that countless gamers and industry professionals looked forward to each year.
