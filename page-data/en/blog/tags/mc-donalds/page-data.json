For those who like burger from <a href=\"http://www.mcdonalds.com.br/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mc Donalds</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bobs.com.br/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bobs</a> among others, youâ€™ll like it because itâ€™s the same style of burger, okay itâ€™s not so tasty but itâ€™s very good = D. The bread is soft and the meat of the burger too, you just canâ€™t leave too much time in the microwave or you can pass the point and make the bread a little hard, but in the box comes the right instructions for you not to leave your <a href=\"http://www.hotpocket.com.br/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hot Pocket</a> pass the point.</p>\n<p>The only problem is the price, it is not R$3.00 reais as the first time I bought it, the normal price I find there is R$4.70 and with luck R$3.50.</p>\n<p>Today I went to the market and went to check the price: R$2.60!!! It was very cheap, so I bought ten of them lol! I have a stock of <a href=\"http://www.hotpocket.com.br/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hot Pockets</a> here at home, until at least the next two weeks.</p>\n<p>If you like burgers, I advise you to keep an eye on the offers and take advantage when <a href=\"http://www.hotpocket.com.br/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hot Pocket</a> is in a good price range.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hotpocket.com.br/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hot Pocket</a> from <a href=\"http://www.sadia.com.br/br/novahome/index.asp\" title=\"Official website \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sadia</a> really impressed me and now itâ€™s on the list of my quick meals at home, if I were to give a general score, it would be 7.0. A comparative note: For a <a href=\"http://www.mcdonalds.com.br/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mc Donalds</a> burger Iâ€™d give it an 8.0.</p>\n<h2 id=\"final-score-70\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#final-score-70\" aria-label=\"final score 70 permalink\" class=\"post-headers-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Final score: 7.0</h2>\n<p>Photos of my ten <a href=\"http://www.hotpocket.com.br/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hot Pocket</a>:</p>\n<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;
