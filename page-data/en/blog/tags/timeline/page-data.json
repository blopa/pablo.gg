Much like Miyamoto once said “Ocarina of Time is the very first story!“. It turns out that we recently discovered that it is not quite like that: During this year’s E3, Skyward Sword, the new game in the Zelda series for Wii, was revealed.</p>\n<p>What happens is that in this game it is revealed how the Master Sword becomes Master Sword, and seeing that the Master Sword already existed in the Ocarina of Time, obviously Skyward Sword comes from all Zeldas. Which made it all very problematic, as I spent hours and hours putting the timeline together, and often some stories made perfect sense to stay before Ocarina of Time, but I couldn’t because of the simple fact that Ocarina of Time was the first Zelda , well, no more.</p>\n<p>At least Skyward Sword arrived already explaining A LOT, even with so little revealed. The fact that Skyward Sword can become Master Sword explains perfectly why Picori Sword and Lokomo Sword look so much like Master Sword - Somehow Master Sword ends up becoming Picori / Lokomo Sword.</p>\n<p>As few details were revealed about Skyward Sword, I prefer not to think about the timeline for now, even though despite explaining some things, Skyward Sword brought much more doubts than clarity.</p>\n<p>So I’m releasing below the post I intended to do on Zelda’s timeline. Get ready for a huge <a href=\"http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Wall_of_Text\" title=\"Wall of Text\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">WOT</a>!</p>\n<p>After researching A LOT, I completed my vision on Zelda’s timeline. I know that many have already done the same, including the GameTrailer website, but with each game released, gaps in these theories are created.</p>\n<p>I’m going to show you my own theory about Zelda’s timeline, of all the Zeldas I’ve played and everything I’ve studied about, I’m satisfied with this being the “official” timeline for me. First of all, one thing we need to understand is that Hyrule is not the name of a world, as ours is Earth.</p>\n<p>It is just a continent of a world that has not yet been revealed, just as Labrynna and Holodrum from Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons are continents in the same way. Another important thing is to know that the game’s hero name is not necessarily Link, so much so that you can choose the name every game start.</p>\n<p>Right then, the first thing we know about the Zelda universe, is the creation of Hyrule by the three Goddesses, Din, Nayru and Farore (In the act of creating the world of Hyrule, multiple universes were created).</p>\n<p>Then there was the great war in Hyrule, known as the Hyrulean Civil War to see who had the power of the Triforce, the war ended with the Triforce in the hands of the Royal Family of Hyrule, thus beginning the events of Ocarina of Time.</p>\n<p>Despite Aonuma’s hasty announcement about Four Swords for GBA, in which he claims that this game is the first on Zelda’s timeline, I rely more on the quotes in which he really was part of the game’s story development, not as a producer, like he was on Four Swords. After the events in Ocarina of Time, we have the famous split timeline, in which one Link goes back in time and tells Princess Zelda everything about Ganondorf and his plans, and in the other he continues in the future devastated by Ganondorf’s power.</p>\n<p>We will now continue with the timeline in which Link would remain an adult. After the world was destroyed by Ganondorf, the events mentioned in the backstory of Wind Waker occur: The king and the people of Hyrule asked the Gods to flood the world, afraid of the evil power of Ganon, who somehow resurrected and for some reason. reason was not prevented by Link.</p>\n<p>I don’t know this story will turn out to be some Zelda game, but I’ll leave a question at that point. Hundreds of years have passed and a new Link is born, he receives an outfit from his grandmother on his birthday, as a ritual of waiting for the hero to return from the past. These are the events of Wind Waker. This Link meets a pirate named Tetra who later reveals himself to be the reincarnation of the princess of Hyrule, Zelda and the King of Red Lions is revealed to be the former king who flooded Hyrule, Daphnes Nohansen Hyrule.</p>\n<p>After collecting the pieces of the Triforce of Courage and killing Ganondorf, Zelda and Link are given the mission to seek a new land to rule. Link and Tetra go in search of new lands, and are faced with a ghost ship, causing the events of Phantom Hourglass, where Link wakes up in an unknown land and Tetra is missing. Determined to find Tetra, Link goes on yet another adventure, where in the end it is revealed that Link was not in his world, but in the World of the Ocean King.</p>\n<p>Upon returning to their own world, the sailors on Tetra’s ship claim that the two were unconscious on the fanstasma ship for just 10 minutes, so Link looks in his pocket and finds the Phantom Hourglass. An adventure in a parallel universe or just a dream?</p>\n<p>It doesn’t really matter, as Spirit Tracks events follow. Many quotes in the game itself show that this new realm was found by Link and Zelda’s ancestors, who named it Hyrule, because of the old realm forgotten by people. One weird thing about Spirit Tracks is the Lokomo Sword, which was designed by the Gods to humans to defeat the bad in the past. She has an incredible resemblance to the Master Sword. Would it be itself with a different name, or does each land have its own weapon to fight evil?</p>\n<p>This remains open, everyone thinks what they want. Now, after Spirit Tracks, not much is known, so I’m going to fit a game that starts in a game that doesn’t know much about the past: Minish Cap. But between Minish Cap and Spirit Tracks I would like to put the future Zelda for Wii.</p>\n<p>Not that much is already known about the game, but what everything indicates is that it will be a game that will show a lot about Master Sword, and perhaps explain the Master Sword / Picori Sword transition. In Minish Cap, a new villain appears: Vaati.</p>\n<p>A sorcerer who only wants to become more powerful, and for that he needs the “Light Power” (triforce of wisdom?) That Princess Zelda has. Link once again has the mission to save Princess Zelda and on the way to his adventure, he forges the Four Sword and defeats Vaati.</p>\n<p>Since this Zelda doesn’t comment on Triforce or Ganon, the only thing we can imagine is that it is hundreds of years after Spirit Tracks, but one thing is certain: Minish have always existed. In a quote from the game, it says that the Minish have fun hiding items and breaks under rocks and grass around the world. After Minish Cap, obviously comes the Game Boy Advance’s Four Swords, in which Vaati manages to escape his prison and kidnaps Princess Zelda. Link goes after it to rescue Zelda and reseals Vaati on the Four Sword.</p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter comes the Four Swords Adventures, for Game Cube, in which Vaati is released again and at the end of the game it is revealed that Vaati was just being manipulated by Ganon, Link defeats Vaati and Ganon and saddles Ganon on the Four Sword. Here ends the timeline of the adult link for Ocarina of Time. Now let’s go back to the beginning of everything: Ocarina of Time’s Link goes back in time and tells Princess Zelda everything about Ganondorf and his plans and Ganondorf is sentenced to death.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Link says goodbye to Zelda as he goes in search of his companion Navi, who left him at the end of Ocarina of Time. While looking for Navi, Link gets lost in Lost Woods and is approached by a Skull Kid, who steals his Ocarina of Time and Epona, while following him, Link is teleported to another world, a universe parallel to Hyrule. Once there, Link learns that the moon is about to fall, and Link has only three days to stop the moon.</p>\n<p>At the end of the third day, Link uses the Ocarina of Time to go back in time and continue his adventure. At the end of the game, it is not very clear whether or not Link returns to Hyrule, but there are theories that he appears in the Twilight Princess in the form of Stalfo, I will talk about this later.</p>\n<p>Returning to the timeline, a while passed by Ocarina of Time and a tribe of dark magicians known as Dark Interlopers tried to get the Triforce using the power of the Fused Shadow but were stopped by the Light Spirits. Again, I don’t know if there will be a Zelda based on this story, so I’ll leave a question here. Hundreds of years later, the events of Twilight Princess take place, in which Ganondorf tries to dominate Hyrule again, but this time manipulating Zant, a being of the Twilight Realm, which I also believe to be the Dark World, as well as many.</p>\n<p>After defeating Zant, Link battles Ganondorf and defeats him with the Master Sword. After the events of Twilight Princess, many hundreds of years pass, and for some reason, Triforce is separated into several pieces. After the events of Twilight Princess, the A Link to The Past begins, in which the Imprisoning War is introduced, which is not known for sure if the events occurred in Twilight Princess or Ocarina of Time. Link to the Past begins on a night when Link wakes up to the telepathic cry for help made by Zelda, who tries to call someone to her rescue, upon hearing the words Link’s Uncle takes his shield and sword and goes after it to rescue the Princess. Link gets up from his bed and goes after his uncle, to try to help him.</p>\n<p>Ahead, again Zelda helps Link enter the castle by revealing a hidden passage that was in the corner gardens, going there, Link finds his uncle lying on the floor, he asks him to help Zelda to free himself from the wizard Agahnim. Zelda and Link then meet and go to a secret room, arriving there with a priest who tells Link that to end the chaos created by Agahnim, Link needs to recover the Master Sword that is hidden in Lost Woods.</p>\n<p>After going through one of the most difficult adventures of all Zelda games, Link and Zelda defeat Ganon, who planned to escape the Dark World, manipulating the wizard Agahnim to release him from his seal, Ganon is sealed again, along with the Dark world. After the events of Link to the Past, for some reason Link is absent from Hyrule, and Ganon manages to break free from the Dark World, it is not explained very well how. A new hero, who is not Link appears, is the “Hero of the Light” in which he can be chosen as a man or woman at the beginning of the game.</p>\n<p>The story takes place in 4 weeks, in the first week the hero wakes up in one of the houses of A Link to the Past and is given the task of rescuing Princess Zelda. Over the course of the four weeks, the hero learns more about Ganon and Link and how he should stop Ganon. In the fourth week the hero defeats Ganon, places the Master Sword where it belongs and is teleported back to where it belongs. Many years later, a new Link appears and has the mission to stop Ganon’s actions again, these are the events that took place in the first Legend of Zelda, which as Miyamoto himself said, A Link to the Past are the ancestors of Link and Zelda of the first Legend of Zelda.</p>\n<p>After gathering the 8 pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom and defeating Ganon, the Adventure of Link events begin, where he is summoned for another mission by Impa. It reveals to Link that many generations ago, there was a kingdom where a king reigned with justice and wisdom using the power of the Triforce. This king hid a part of the Triforce, the Triforce of Courage, and reported the secret location only to his daughter Zelda.</p>\n<p>When the king passed away, his son wanted to know the location of the Triforce, but his sister Zelda did not want to reveal it, so he sent a witch to use a spell to force his sister to reveal the location of the Triforce, and was unsuccessful. Then the witch cast a spell on Princess Zelda that put her to sleep. Terrified by the tragedy, the prince ordered that from that generation, all the princesses of Hyrule should be called Zelda.</p>\n<p>This was a very important event, which is very different from the Wind Waker timeline, in which we have Tetra. Returning to Adventure of Link, after Link restored the Triforce of Courage and woke up Princess Zelda, she is kidnapped by dragons and begins the Game &#x26; Watch Zelda.</p>\n<p>Many disregard this game, but it is an official Nintendo release and should not be disregarded. After providing many services of the Royal Family and saving Hyrule, Triforce summons Link and sends him to a distant kingdom that needs help.</p>\n<p>Then the Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages events begin. When one of the two games is finished and you start the second game with the code given at the end of the first, the true story of the game is revealed. At the end of the game (if you started with the code after finishing the other one) it is revealed that Zelda had been captured by Ganondorf’s mothers due to trying to resuscitate Ganon.</p>\n<p>At the end of the game Link defeats Ganon and goes out on a raft back to his homeland, Hyrule. But a storm causes him to get lost, and ends up stopping on Koholint Island. Link learns that to leave this island, he first needs to wake up Wind Fish, and upon waking him up, Link discovers that the island he was on was just a creation of a Wind Fish dream, the game is over and it is not clear whether Link made it home or not.</p>\n<p>After Link’s Awakening, many years have passed and A Link to the Past events begin. I know it’s almost official that Link’s Awakening is a sequel to A Link to the Past, but there were also a lot of mistakes in translating from Japanese to English, but it wouldn’t be possible to put Link to the Past as the protagonist of Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons for the simple fact that in Oracle of Age / Seasons you eliminate Ganon, and following A Link to The Past, where Link is not the hero but “The Hero of Light”, Ganon is also defeated , making this connection impossible, as there would be two Ganons at the same time in different lands.</p>\n<p>Yeah, quite a lot! I guarantee you that this placement there, even before the Skyward Sword announcement was the one that made the most sense, despite some small inconsistencies, but that could be fixed with perhaps some other game between the stories.</p>\n<p>I will do the timeline again, we just need to know a little more about the Skyward Sword story. Until then, we only have … I don’t know, keep thinking until the brain burns !!!</p>","fields":{"postHashId":"Z2FtZXN0cnVlLi4vLi4vY292ZXJzLzIwMTAvcG9zdC1pZC0yMTc0LWNvdmVyLnBuZzIwMTAtMDctMDNUMDA6MDA6MDAuMDAwWg==","slug":"/2010/2010-07-03-zelda-timeline-and-skyward-sword-placement.en/","path":"/blog/games/zelda-timeline-and-skyward-sword-placement/","locale":"en"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["skyward sword","timeline","zelda","games","general"],"categories":["games"],"allowComments":true,"publishOnMedium":false,"cover":"../../covers/2010/post-id-2174-cover.png","date":"2010-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","id":2174,"path":"zelda-timeline-and-skyward-sword-placement","show":true,"title":"Zelda timeline and Skyward Sword placement","hideExcerpt":false,"subtitle":""}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1024px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 74.609375%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"zelda timeline\"\n        title=\"Timeline?\"\n        src=\"/static/005db0a6b1c97cf3fe316178eea48eb3/63217/zelda_timeline.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/005db0a6b1c97cf3fe316178eea48eb3/db830/zelda_timeline.jpg 256w,\n/static/005db0a6b1c97cf3fe316178eea48eb3/8102f/zelda_timeline.jpg 512w,\n/static/005db0a6b1c97cf3fe316178eea48eb3/63217/zelda_timeline.jpg 1024w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span>\n    <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\">Timeline?</figcaption>\n  </figure></p>\n<p>Did you see this post’s title? Yes, I’m going to talk about a really discussed subject that exists on any forum/blog/fotolog/twitter/bar/museum/school on the world: The timeline of <a href=\"http://zelda.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zelda</a> . Is there really one? Why does <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigeru_Miyamoto\" title=\"Shigeru Miyamoto on Wikipédia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> loves to do those mind blower s that lets everybody INSANE? If you lost your hopes trying to find a correct timeline for <a href=\"http://zelda.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zelda</a>, I hope that this post will put you back on track in the way of hope and that one day we’ll understand the universe of <a href=\"http://zelda.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zelda</a> and its timeline.</p>\n<p>To start, watch this video:</p>\n<p><div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.42857142857143%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <div class=\"embedVideo-container\"> <iframe title=\"\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/F2g65jL3HDg?rel=0\" class=\"embedVideo-iframe\" style=\"border:0; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \" loading=\"eager\" allowfullscreen=\"\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"></iframe> </div> </div></p>\n<p>Now that you’re finished you must be thinking: “WOW, AWSOME!”, just like me and others. Some months after this new theory’s been created, the video’s author sent it to <a href=\"http://nintendo.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nintendo</a>, asking if he got any close to a solution to the timeline of <a href=\"http://zelda.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zelda</a>, and <a href=\"http://nintendo.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nintendo</a> answered this:Resuming: are we screwed? No, not at all. What happened here?</p>\n<p>Someone really addicted to <a href=\"http://zelda.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zelda</a> searched a little bit, was able to make lots of connections between <a href=\"http://zelda.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zelda</a> games and made this really famous video on <a href=\"http://youtube.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">YouTube</a>, and when he got in contact with <a href=\"http://nintendo.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nintendo</a>, got the response that there was no timeline on <a href=\"http://zelda.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zelda</a>.</p>\n<p>Well, I was really upset with <a href=\"http://nintendo.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nintendo’s</a> response, and resolved to e-mail them. I wrote about the contact between <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/ocarinahero10\" title=\"ocarinahero10 on YouTube\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ocarinahero10</a> and its videos, I talked about what <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigeru_Miyamoto\" title=\"Shigeru Miyamoto on Wikipédia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Miyamoto</a> himself said once, that there are two timelines on <a href=\"http://zelda.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zelda</a> and even quote the <a href=\"http://zelda.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeldas</a> that have official sequences ( <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda_(video_game)\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zelda</a> -> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelda_II:_The_Adventure_of_Link\" title=\"Zelda II on Wikipédia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zelda II</a> ; <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocarina_of_Time\" title=\"Ocarina of Time on Wikipédia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ocarina of Time</a> -> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Majora&#x27;s_Mask\" title=\"Majora&#x27;s Mask on Wikipédia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Majora’s Mask</a> ; <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_Waker\" title=\"Wind Waker on Wikipédia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Wind Waker</a> -> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_Hourglass\" title=\"Phantom Hourglass on Wikipédia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Phantom Hourglass</a> ; <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_of_Seasons\" title=\"Oracle of Seasons on Wikipédia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Oracle of Seasons</a> -> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_of_Ages\" title=\"Oracle of Ages on Wikipédia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Oracle of Ages</a> ), and here’s the answer of <a href=\"http://nintendo.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nintendo</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hello Pablo,</p>\n<p>Since the first Legend of Zelda game was released on the NES years ago, fans of the series have tried to fit each game into a timeline, each game representing a separate episode of Link’s life. This has lead to much speculation and discussion, particularly over the games where Link switches between adult and young boy.</p>\n<p>The 2003 release of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker finally put an end to the speculation and discussion in its opening line, “This is but one of the legends of which people speak…” The basic assumption has always been that Link is a single individual. However, in an interview given at the time it was released, the game’s director, Eiji Aonuma (speaking for himself and Shigeru Miyamoto, the original creator of the series) stated “In our opinions, with the Legend of Zelda, every game has a new Link. A new hero named Link always rises to fight evil.”</p>\n<p>This means that–unless otherwise specified–each new game represents a new Link and that there isn’t a true frame of reference or timeline possible for the series. For additional information on The Legend of Zelda series, please visit our official Legend of Zelda website at the following address:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.zelda.com/universe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">www.zelda.com/universe/</a></p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Sharon Matheny</p>\n<p>Nintendo of America Inc.</p>\n<p>Nintendo’s home page: <a href=\"http://www.nintendo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.nintendo.com/</a></p>\n<p>Power Line (Automated Product Info): (425) 885-7529</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Uhmn, wait a minute… I’ve seen that response somewhere… right! I got the same response that on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/ocarinahero10\" title=\"ocarinahero10 on YouTube\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ocarinahero10</a>, but what does this means? It means that <a href=\"http://nintendo.com/\" title=\"official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nintendo’s</a> website has a system that identifies the words “Zelda” and “timeline” and doesn’t even bother to read what you say, and send you that automatic e-mail. Kind of boring, right? So I give it a GOOD look on the internet about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigeru_Miyamoto\" title=\"Shigeru Miyamoto on Wikipédia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Miyamoto</a> saying that there is a chronological sequence on <a href=\"http://zelda.com/\" title=\"official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zelda</a>, and I did find it, here it is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigeru_Miyamoto\" title=\"Shigeru Miyamoto on Wikipédia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Miyamoto’s</a> statement:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Ocarina of Time is the first story, then the original Legend of Zelda, then Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, and finally A Link to the Past. It’s not very clear where Link’s Awakening fits in–it could be anytime after Ocarina of Time.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And his one from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiji_Aonuma\" title=\"Eiji Aonuma on Wikipédia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Eiji Aonuma</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“As for the timeline, Twilight Princess is set several hundred years after Link has fought Ganondorf in Ocarina of Time and returned to his own time (the OoT ending), and becomes a parallel world to The Wind Waker (the time axis originally splits in Ocarina of Time and a parallel timeline is formed). Wind Waker begins several hundred years immediately after adult Link seals away Ganondorf, Twilight Princess occurs several hundred years after the adult Link is sent back to his original time by Zelda’s power.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Two powerful quotes spoken by who’s behind the game, which proves that <a href=\"http://zelda.com/\" title=\"official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zelda</a> HAS a timeline =D And now that you’re finishing reading this post, you’re very happy hearing such news, but there is one problem: sources.</p>\n<p>All sources of those information, were took from blogs and websites about <a href=\"http://zelda.com/\" title=\"official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zelda</a>, so how can we tell they’re true? Well, I searched a little bit about the sources, I spent like 5 hours searching where the first quote was from, and I found out that it came from an exclusive interview with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigeru_Miyamoto\" title=\"Shigeru Miyamoto on Wikipédia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Miyamoto</a> to a magazine called <a href=\"http://nintendopower.com/\" title=\"official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nintendo Power</a> in November of 1998, <a href=\"http://www.miyamotoshrine.com/theman/interviews/111998.shtml\" title=\"miyamotoshrine.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>click here</strong></a> to read it.</p>\n<p>This interview was published on January of 1999 in a special edition of <a href=\"http://nintendopower.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nintendo Power</a> #116, the edition that only who have a subscription of the magazine gets it. I searched on eBay for that special edition but I didn’t find it =( So I e-mailed <a href=\"http://nintendopower.com/\" title=\"official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nintendo Power</a> and <a href=\"http://nintendo.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nintendo</a> with the link of the interview, asking if it’s really true, and they answered yes!</p>\n<p>So the first quote about Ocarina of Time being the first <a href=\"http://zelda.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zelda</a> ever it’s true and was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigeru_Miyamoto\" title=\"Shigeru Miyamoto on Wikipédia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Miyamoto</a> himself who said it =D The source of the second quote was a lot easier to find, I searched on the official website of <a href=\"http://www.nindori.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nintendo Dream</a>, japanese magazine of <a href=\"http://nintendo.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nintendo</a>, and I found the edition that has that quote, to access the interview (in japanese) <a href=\"http://www.nindori.com/interview/154zelda/154int_02.html\" title=\"Nintendo Dream\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>click here</strong></a>, and to see the translation (english by <a href=\"http://translate.google.com/translate_t?hl=pt-br#\" title=\"Tradutor da Google\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Google translator</a> ) <a href=\"http://translate.google.com.br/translate?hl=pt-BR&#x26;sl=ja&#x26;tl=en&#x26;u=http://www.nindori.com/interview/154zelda/154int_02.html\" title=\"Nintendo Dream\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>click here</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>You can also check the translated version by Patricia and TSA, from <a href=\"http://www.thehylia.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">thehylia.com/</a> by <a href=\"http://www.thehylia.com/index.php?subaction=showfull&#x26;id=1173582355\" title=\"Translation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>clicking here</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>There, job done! <span\n          \n          class='highlighted-text'\n        >Zelda POSSESSES a timeline</span>, we only have to wait for Shigeru Miyamoto on Wikipédia to start launching new games of Official website that are connected to the ones that already exist.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://zelda.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zelda</a> is an adventure game, really rich in puzzles, which, for who is more addicted to it, brings a fantasy story like no other before.</p>\n<p>We’ll keep on playing <a href=\"http://zelda.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zelda</a> to the end of times o/</p>\n<p>Also check out <a href=\"/en/zelda-timeline\">the Zelda Timeline secret page I have on this blog</a>.</p>","fields":{"postHashId":"Z2FtZXN0cnVlLi4vLi4vY292ZXJzLzIwMDkvcG9zdC1pZC0xMzI5LWNvdmVyLnBuZzIwMDktMDktMTVUMDA6MDA6MDAuMDAwWg==","slug":"/2009/2009-09-15-zelda-timeline.en/","path":"/blog/games/zelda-timeline/","locale":"en"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["zelda","games","timeline","theories"],"categories":["games"],"allowComments":true,"publishOnMedium":false,"cover":"../../covers/2009/post-id-1329-cover.png","date":"2009-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","id":1329,"path":"zelda-timeline","show":true,"title":"Zelda timeline?","hideExcerpt":false,"subtitle":""}}}],"ogImage":"/static/005db0a6b1c97cf3fe316178eea48eb3/63217/zelda_timeline.jpg","language":"en","intl":{"language":"en","languages":["en","pt-br"],"messages":{"site_title":"pablo.gg","title":"Title","author":"@thepiratepablo","search_placeholder":"Search...","about":"About","photos":"Photos","archive":"Archive","contact":"Contact","close":"Close","contact_page":"Contact page","see_more":"See more posts","built_with":"Built with ","buy_me_a_soda":"Buy me a soda","blog":"Blog","blog_posts":"Blog posts","go_to_post":"Go to post","search":"Search","loading":"Loading...","search_results":"Search results","search_results_for":"{quantity} search results for: \"{query}\"","search_for_query":"Search for \"{query}\"","no_results":"No results","home":"Home","description":"Yet another developer personal blog","go_back":"Go back to the homepage","thats_me":"That's me!","got_it":"Got it!","check_it_out":"Check it out!","we_are":"We are","e3":"E3","away_from_next_sgf":"away from Summer Game Fest 2025","away_from_next_gamescom":"away from Gamescom 2024","sgf_countdown":"Summer Game Fest Countdown","gamescom_countdown":"Gamescom Countdown","e3_paragraph_1":"This page once featured a countdown to the next E3 event, a moment that countless gamers and industry professionals looked forward to each year.
