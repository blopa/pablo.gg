I pretty much just <a href=\"https://github.com/blopa/Resume-Builder\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">copy</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/blopa/gatsby-material-ui-blog-starter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">paste</a> the same code from one Gatsby project to another, and this time was no different.</p>\n<p>The great thing about Gatsby is that I can fetch the data in the <code class=\"language-text\">node.js</code> part of Gatsby, and filter out any data I don’t want to send to the frontend, like the user email, and tcharam, with no data leakage. For this project, I didn’t have to do this, but I do it for this blog - so whenever a user leaves a comment with their email, that email never shows up in the frontend build.</p>\n<p>This project will have 2 different parts, the Gatsby site, which I will build once, <a href=\"https://github.com/WeRules/home-finder/blob/main/src/utils/gatsby-node-helpers.js#L18\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">get the form data from Google Forms using Node Fetch</a>, and the script that <a href=\"https://github.com/WeRules/home-finder-script/blob/main/scraper.js#L17\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">will download the Google Spreadsheet data</a> and parse it with <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/xlsx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">xlsx</a>.</p>\n<p>I also want to make sure I won’t send the same house to the same user twice, and for that, I will need a database to persist the houses I already send to that user, for that I will simply use a <code class=\"language-text\">db.json</code> file with the following structure:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\r\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"user@email.com\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">\"https://somelink.com\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"https://otherlink.com\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\r\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"user2@email.com\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token string\">\"https://linklink.com\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\r\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>To persist this data to the repo, I will use the <a href=\"https://github.com/stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">git-auto-commit-action</a> GitHub Action. This is problematic because now anyone can go to that repo and see all the users’ emails and links, and I can’t have that, so that repo needs to be private, but you can clone <a href=\"https://github.com/WeRules/home-finder-script\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this one</a> to your own GitHub account if you want.</p>\n<h2 id=\"limitations\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#limitations\" aria-label=\"limitations permalink\" class=\"post-headers-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Limitations</h2>\n<p>Since I don’t want to use more than the GitHub Actions free tier, I will be running the script every hour, this should be enough to not pass the monthly limit - well, it depends on the number of users, of course.</p>\n<p>I also had to manually write the scraping scripts for <a href=\"https://github.com/WeRules/home-finder-script/blob/main/scraper.js#L133\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">various real estate websites</a>, so it’s not like you can get notifications from any website anywhere in the Netherlands.</p>\n<p>That’s why I made this free and open-source and I highly encourage people to deploy their own version and change the frequency of the scraping script to match their needs.</p>\n<p>There’s also a chance that any of the websites can block the user-agent from scraping them, in this case, you need to keep an eye on it and change the user-agent if needed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"deploying-your-own-version\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#deploying-your-own-version\" aria-label=\"deploying your own version permalink\" class=\"post-headers-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Deploying your own version</h2>\n<p>To deploy your own version you will need to clone 2 GitHub repos, the <a href=\"https://github.com/WeRules/home-finder\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Home Finder</a> and the <a href=\"https://github.com/WeRules/home-finder-script\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Home Finder Script</a>.

there.</p>\n<p>If you have a nice idea, deploy it to GitHub Pages, use GitHub Actions, use Google Spreadsheet (ok ok, or Firebase) and start your project from there, if you use more than the free tier it’s probably a good time to start scaling, and maybe thinking about making some revenue or find partners or investors for your idea.</p>\n<p>Good luck, and if you’re looking for a house in the Netherlands, don’t forget to use <a href=\"https://werules.github.io/home-finder/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Home Finder</a> and recommend it to your friends.</p>\n<p>See you in the
