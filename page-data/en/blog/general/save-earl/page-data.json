But to get the inner works, only with time!</p>\n<p>I spent almost a month playing several hours with <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote</a> a bunch of games that I have on my <a href=\"http://www.nokia.com.br/A4799272\" title=\"Nokia E51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nokia E51</a> and I’ll make a review talking about the pros and cons of <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote</a>. Soon as I grabbed my Zeemote, I had a little problem: Batteries. Well, two AAA batteries are a problem, they’re expensive and don’t last long, but with time, I’ve realised that they last a lot with <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote</a>, but is always better to buy rechargeable batteries.</p>\n<p>To synchronize <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote</a> with your cellphone is a really simple process, you have to install <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote’s</a> software ( <a href=\"http://www.zeemote.com/zeekey/\" title=\"Zeekey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeekey</a> ), which has Portuguese language, and in it you’ll have a simple step-by-step explaining how to connect <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote</a> on your device. After you connect it, let’s go to the configs: You can create lots of different profiles, each one of them with its own key mapping personalized to the game you want to play. After the key mapping is done, you just have to select the profile you want to use and let <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote</a> running in background: You’re now free to run any game you want to.

But to get the inner works, only with time!\r\n\r\nI spent almost a month playing several hours with [Zeemote](http://zeemote.com/ \"Official website\") a bunch of games that I have on my [Nokia E51](http://www.nokia.com.br/A4799272 \"Nokia E51\") and I'll make a review talking about the pros and cons of [Zeemote](http://zeemote.com/ \"Official website\"). Soon as I grabbed my Zeemote, I had a little problem: Batteries. Well, two AAA batteries are a problem, they're expensive and don't last long, but with time, I've realised that they last a lot with [Zeemote](http://zeemote.com/ \"Official website\"), but is always better to buy rechargeable batteries.\r\n\r\nTo synchronize [Zeemote](http://zeemote.com/ \"Official website\") with your cellphone is a really simple process, you have to install [Zeemote's](http://zeemote.com/ \"Official website\") software ( [Zeekey](http://www.zeemote.com/zeekey/ \"Zeekey\") ), which has Portuguese language, and in it you'll have a simple step-by-step explaining how to connect [Zeemote](http://zeemote.com/ \"Official website\") on your device. After you connect it, let's go to the configs: You can create lots of different profiles, each one of them with its own key mapping personalized to the game you want to play.
