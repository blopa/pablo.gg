Oh no no, this post is about my 28 hours battle to restore my Whatsapp messages backup that led to nothing, well, kind of.</p>\n<p>Whatsapp isn’t really a good app, I think we all kind of know that? Like really, I need to have my phone connected to the internet to use the web version of it? WTF! But fine, we all use it because it’s the app that everyone uses, right? I mean what can you do? I feel you.</p>\n<p>I’m an early adopter of Whatsapp, back when they had a Symbian version of the app I was using it in my Nokia phone, so I’m using it for many and many years, and I always backup my chat history, first with <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keramidas.TitaniumBackup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Titanium Backup</a> and then with the Google Drive integration, which was convenient because I didn’t have to root my phone and void the warranty.</p>\n<h2 id=\"so-what-happened\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#so-what-happened\" aria-label=\"so what happened permalink\" class=\"post-headers-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>So what happened?</h2>\n<p>I got a new phone, a <a href=\"https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_nord_n10_5g-10556.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">OnePlus Nord N10</a>, I know it’s not top-notch but it’s a good upgrade from a <a href=\"https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_moto_z3_play-9003.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Motorola Moto Z3 Play</a> and it has 5G, so I’m happy to help Bill Gates bring the New World Order for us via coronavirus.</p>\n<p>The truth is Whatsapp pisses me off, it’s a super simple yet super buggy and slow messaging app, that I only use to be able to talk to some friends that still don’t use Telegram (noobs). So before moving everything to my new phone, I made a new Whatsapp backup and straight away uninstalled the app from my phone, after all, why would I keep it? I hate it. Silly me…</p>\n<p>I started the process of restoring my Whatsapp backup via Google Drive on my new phone, and then when it hit 24% I got an error: <strong>Couldn’t restore messages</strong>. It’s 10GB of backup data, so I didn’t worry too much and decided to try again, well the thing is that to try again, you need to uninstall Whatsapp and install it again… ok…</p>\n<p>So I did that, and to my surprise, same error, and there is no option to retry or change to restoring from the local storage no no no, if you want to retry, then uninstall and install it again. So I kept trying, different backup sources (local, cloud), different backup files, and then I wasn’t able to ask for an SMS for 2 hours?? lol ok. I waited, tried again, it didn’t work of course, and then I had to wait 7 hours. Awesome.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 576px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 222.265625%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Now let&#39;s wait 24h\"\n        title=\"Now let&#39;s wait 24h\"\n        src=\"/static/ac157d47debff09e795b787faedeee4d/17d4d/whatsapp-waiting-time.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/ac157d47debff09e795b787faedeee4d/db830/whatsapp-waiting-time.jpg 256w,\n/static/ac157d47debff09e795b787faedeee4d/8102f/whatsapp-waiting-time.jpg 512w,\n/static/ac157d47debff09e795b787faedeee4d/17d4d/whatsapp-waiting-time.jpg 576w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span>\n    <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\">Now let&#39;s wait 24h</figcaption>\n  </figure></p>\n<p>Then I started researching, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=whatsapp+restore+stuck+at+24&#x26;oq=whatsapp+restore+stuck+at+24%25\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">and many other people have the same problem</a>.

policies, but this post is not about that. Oh no no, this post is about my 28 hours battle to restore my Whatsapp messages backup that led to nothing, well, kind of.</p>\n<p>Whatsapp isn’t really a good app, I think we all kind of know that? Like really, I need to have my phone connected to the internet to use the web version of it? WTF! But fine, we all use it because it’s the app that everyone uses, right? I mean what can you do? I feel you.</p>\n<p>I’m an early adopter of Whatsapp, back when they had a Symbian version of the app I was using it in my Nokia phone, so I’m using it for many and many years, and I always backup my chat history, first with <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keramidas.TitaniumBackup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Titanium Backup</a> and then with the Google Drive integration, which was convenient because I didn’t have to root my phone and void the warranty.</p>\n<h2 id=\"so-what-happened\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#so-what-happened\" aria-label=\"so what happened permalink\" class=\"post-headers-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>So what happened?</h2>\n<p>I got a new phone, a <a href=\"https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_nord_n10_5g-10556.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">OnePlus Nord N10</a>, I know it’s not top-notch but it’s a good upgrade from a <a href=\"https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_moto_z3_play-9003.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Motorola Moto Z3 Play</a> and it has 5G, so I’m happy to help Bill Gates bring the New World Order for us via coronavirus.</p>\n<p>The truth is Whatsapp pisses me off, it’s a super simple yet super buggy and slow messaging app, that I only use to be able to talk to some friends that still don’t use Telegram (noobs). So before moving everything to my new phone, I made a new Whatsapp backup and straight away uninstalled the app from my phone, after all, why would I keep it? I hate it. Silly me…</p>\n<p>I started the process of restoring my Whatsapp backup via Google Drive on my new phone, and then when it hit 24% I got an error: <strong>Couldn’t restore messages</strong>. It’s 10GB of backup data, so I didn’t worry too much and decided to try again, well the thing is that to try again, you need to uninstall Whatsapp and install it again… ok…</p>\n<p>So I did that, and to my surprise, same error, and there is no option to retry or change to restoring from the local storage no no no, if you want to retry, then uninstall and install it again. So I kept trying, different backup sources (local, cloud), different backup files, and then I wasn’t able to ask for an SMS for 2 hours?? lol ok. I waited, tried again, it didn’t work of course, and then I had to wait 7 hours. Awesome.</p>\n<p></p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 576px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 222.265625%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Now let's wait 24h\" title=\"Now let's wait 24h\" src=\"/static/ac157d47debff09e795b787faedeee4d/17d4d/whatsapp-waiting-time.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/ac157d47debff09e795b787faedeee4d/db830/whatsapp-waiting-time.jpg 256w,\n/static/ac157d47debff09e795b787faedeee4d/8102f/whatsapp-waiting-time.jpg 512w,\n/static/ac157d47debff09e795b787faedeee4d/17d4d/whatsapp-waiting-time.jpg 576w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n    </span>\n    <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\">Now let's wait 24h</figcaption>\n  </figure><p></p>\n<p>Then I started researching, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=whatsapp+restore+stuck+at+24&amp;oq=whatsapp+restore+stuck+at+24%25\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">and many other people have the same problem</a>.

E não existe opção de tentar novamente ou mudar para restauração de arquivos no armazenamento local, não não não, se você quiser tentar novamente, desinstale e instale novamente esse incrível aplicativo. Continuei tentando mais algumas vezes, com tipos de backup diferentes (local, nuvem), com arquivos de backup diferentes, e depois de tanto tentar, eu passei a ter que esperar 2 horas para pedir um SMS para ativar a minha conta.

Ah não não, este post é sobre minha batalha de 28 horas para restaurar meu backup de mensagens do Whatsapp que não deu em nada, quer dizer, mais ou menos em nada.\r\n\r\nWhatsapp não é um aplicativo bom, acho que todos nós sabemos disso, né? Tipo é sério que eu preciso ter o meu celular conectado à internet para usar a versão web? Como assim?! Mas tudo bem, todos nós usamos porque é o aplicativo de mensagem que todos usam, certo? Fazer o que?\r\n\r\nEu sou da galera que começou a usar o Whatsapp assim que ele saiu, quando ainda tinha uma versão Symbian que eu usava no meu Nokia, então assim, eu já estou usando o Whatsapp por muitos e muitos anos, e sempre faço backup do meu histórico de mensagens, primeiro com [Titanium Backup](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keramidas.TitaniumBackup) e depois com a integração do Google Drive, que foi bem conveniente porque não precisava mais fazer o root no meu celular e ter problemas com a garantia.\r\n\r\n## E o que aconteceu?\r\n\r\nEu comprei um celular novo, um [OnePlus Nord N10](https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_nord_n10_5g-10556.php), eu sei que não é um celular 👌TOP👌™, mas é uma boa atualização para quem está usando o [Motorola Moto Z3 Play](https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_moto_z3_play-9003.php) e ainda por cima tem 5G, então eu estou feliz que estou ajudando o Bill Gates a trazer a Nova Ordem Mundial para nós via o coronavírus.\r\n\r\nA verdade é que eu me irrito muito com o Whatsapp, é um aplicativo com poucas features, mas super lento e com muitos bugs, que eu só uso para falar com alguns amigos que ainda não usam o Telegram (noobs). Antes de mover tudo para o meu celular novo, eu fiz um novo backup do Whatsapp e logo em seguida já desinstalei ele do meu celular, de tanto ódio que eu tenho. Isso foi um erro.\r\n\r\nEu iniciei o processo de restauração do backup do Whatsapp através do Google Drive no meu celular novo e, quando atingiu 24%, apareceu um erro: __Não foi possível restaurar o backup__. São 10GB de backup, então não me preocupei muito e resolvi tentar de novo, bom acontece que para tentar de novo, você precisa desinstalar o Whatsapp e instalar novamente... ok...\r\n\r\nEntão eu fui la instalei e desinstalei, tentei denovo, e para minha surpresa aconteceu o mesmo erro. E não existe opção de tentar novamente ou mudar para restauração de arquivos no armazenamento local, não não não, se você quiser tentar novamente, desinstale e instale novamente esse incrível aplicativo. Continuei tentando mais algumas vezes, com tipos de backup diferentes (local, nuvem), com arquivos de backup diferentes, e depois de tanto tentar, eu passei a ter que esperar 2 horas para pedir um SMS para ativar a minha conta. Tá né... Esperei, tentei de novo, e claro que não funcionou, aí tive que esperar 7 horas. Impressionante.\r\n\r\n![Bora esperar 24h](../../uploads/blog/2021/01/whatsapp-waiting-time.jpg)\r\n\r\nEntão comecei a pesquisar [e muitas outras pessoas têm o mesmo problema](https://www.google.com.br/search?q=whatsapp+backup+travou+em+24%25&oq=whatsapp+backup+travou+em+24%25).

Menos de 7 dias depois de [não conseguir restaurar o backup das minhas mensagens no Whatsapp](/pt-br/blog/general/tinha-que-ser-o-whatsapp-de-novo/), o Telegram anunciou que agora você pode [importar mensagens de outros aplicativos de chat](https://telegram.org/blog/move-history/pt-br). Tinha que ser o Telegram denovo, não é mesmo? Como o Telegram consegue ser tão foda? Desde a última atualização você pode importar seu histórico de mensagens do WhatsApp, Line e KakaoTalk, para isso você precisa exportar seu chat do Whatsapp (por exemplo) e compartilhá-lo com o contato equivalente no Telegram.\r\n\r\n![Importando para o Telegram](../../uploads/blog/2021/01/importing-to-telegram.gif)\r\n\r\nO Telegram disse que eventualmente disponibilizará uma API para que você possa construir seus próprios scripts e importar mensagens de qualquer aplicativo de chat, next level foda! Mas... temos mesmo que esperar essa atualização? Uhmn acho que não eim. Vamos dar uma olhada como é esse arquivo `.txt` exportado do Whatsapp:\r\n\r\n```\r\n8/13/10, 12:11 - Scott Pilgrim: Qual é o site da Amazon.ca?\r\n8/13/10, 12:12 - Wallace Wells: Amazon.ca..\r\n```\r\n\r\nEntão digamos que, como eu, você só tenha acesso ao seu arquivo `msgstore.db` do Whatsapp, não é possível exportar o chat do Whatsapp, certo? Neste caso você pode usar a ferramenta [Whatsapp Viewer](https://github.com/andreas-mausch/whatsapp-viewer) para exportar suas mensagens para um arquivo `JSON`, que fica nesse formato:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"key\": \"0000000000000@s.whatsapp.net\",\r\n    \"contactName\": \"Wallace Wells\",\r\n    \"messages\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"timestamp\": \"2010-08-13T12:11:00Z\",\r\n            \"fromMe\": true,\r\n            \"type\": \"text\",\r\n            \"text\": \"Qual é o site da Amazon.ca?\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"timestamp\": \"2010-08-13T12:12:00Z\",\r\n            \"fromMe\": false,\r\n            \"type\": \"text\",\r\n            \"text\": \"Amazon.ca..\"\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAgora tudo que você precisa fazer é carregar este arquivo `JSON` com um script qualquer e converte-lo para um `.txt` naquele formato. Vamos tentar fazer isso usando `Node.js`:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst {\r\n    readFileSync,\r\n    writeFileSync,\r\n} = require('fs');\r\n\r\nconst yourName = 'Scott Pilgrim'; // TODO put your name here\r\n\r\nconst convertMessageObjToTxt = (messageObj, sender) => {\r\n    // format \"2010-08-13T12:11:00Z\"\r\n    const dateObj = new Date(messageObj.timestamp);\r\n    const date = dateObj.toLocaleDateString('en-US');\r\n    const time = dateObj.toLocaleTimeString('en-US', { hour12: false }).slice(0, 5);\r\n\r\n    // format is \"M/DD/YY, HH:MM - Sender's Name: Message\"\r\n    return date + ', ' + time + ' - ' + sender + ': ' + messageObj.text + '\\n';\r\n}\r\n\r\nif (process.argv[2]) {\r\n    // read the JSON file\r\n    const chatJson = JSON.parse(readFileSync(process.argv[2], 'utf8'));\r\n    let txtContent = '';\r\n\r\n    chatJson.messages.forEach((message) => {\r\n        txtContent += convertMessageObjToTxt(\r\n            message,\r\n            message.fromMe ? yourName : chatJson.contactName\r\n        );\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    // save is as a .txt\r\n    writeFileSync(`${process.argv[2]}.txt`, txtContent);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nExecute esse script com o comando `node script.js seu-arquivo-json.json` e o resultado será um arquivo `.txt` que você pode importar para o Telegram.
