It’s been over 10 years since I’ve written a game review, but the last one I wrote was for Metroid: Other M (which you can find <a href=\"https://www.nintendoblast.com.br/2010/09/analise-metroid-other-m-wii.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> in Portuguese).

As a Game Boy Advance owner with a few games, I eagerly awaited the release of Metroid Fusion, which fell between my birthday and Christmas.</p>\n<p>Unable to wait any longer, I decided to purchase a copy of the Nintendo World magazine, which featured a complete walkthrough of the game, when I saw it on the newsstand. My excitement for the game was palpable, and I couldn’t resist the temptation to get my hands on the magazine right away.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1024px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 130.078125%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"nintendo world 52\"\n        title=\"nintendo world 52\"\n        src=\"/static/69f337d7ba7ebab784eac20fbd7e431c/42a19/nintendo_world_52.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/69f337d7ba7ebab784eac20fbd7e431c/e3135/nintendo_world_52.png 256w,\n/static/69f337d7ba7ebab784eac20fbd7e431c/06341/nintendo_world_52.png 512w,\n/static/69f337d7ba7ebab784eac20fbd7e431c/42a19/nintendo_world_52.png 1024w,\n/static/69f337d7ba7ebab784eac20fbd7e431c/e8464/nintendo_world_52.png 1536w,\n/static/69f337d7ba7ebab784eac20fbd7e431c/41183/nintendo_world_52.png 1603w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p>As a result of my good behavior throughout the year, Santa gifted me with a copy of Metroid Fusion for Christmas.

WHAT!?</p>\n<p>The game, developed by Spanish company MercurySteam (known for their work on the Metroid: Samus Returns remake of Metroid II: Return of Samus), was slated for release later in the year, much to the delight of fans.</p>\n<p>While Metroid: Samus Returns received mixed reviews from critics, I personally found the game to be enjoyable, though not particularly groundbreaking. Some of the level design choices didn’t quite appeal to me, but I was still thrilled to see the return of 2D Metroid gameplay.</p>\n<p>When the package for Metroid Dread arrived at my house, I was so excited to play the game that I even forgot to film an unboxing video for <a href=\"https://playreplay.com.br/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">PlayReplay</a> 😅!</p>\n<p>After a satisfying weekend of gameplay, I completed Metroid Dread with a total of 11 hours and 30 minutes played and 87% of items collected. While it may not be a world record, I’m proud of my progress and the amount of items I was able to collect.</p>\n<p>Now, let’s get started with my review of the game.</p>\n<h2 id=\"level-design\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#level-design\" aria-label=\"level design permalink\" class=\"post-headers-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Level Design</h2>\n<p>Metroid Dread features 8 interconnected areas, connected by tunnels, elevators, and teleports. These connections are seamlessly integrated, creating a believable alien world with both wild and technological elements, and ample opportunities for hidden secrets to be unveiled in every corner.</p>\n<p>MercurySteam managed to capture exactly what makes a Metroid game a Metroid game, and many times I thought I was taking a super secret path and going off the intended path, only to be pleasantly surprised when I ended up exactly where I was supposed to go and found some main power-up or boss. The game is outstanding at using level design to guide you to the right path.</p>\n<p>Metroid Dread is full of secrets and items that will keep players searching and challenged as they try to figure out how to obtain them. I personally encountered many items that initially seemed out of reach due to my lack of certain power-ups, only to later realize that I simply needed to <em><strong>git gud</strong></em> and use shinespark creatively to get them. MercurySteam deserves credit for this aspect of the game. 👏 MercurySteam 👏.</p>\n<p>Overall, the balance of item and boss acquisition is well-paced and keeps players engaged with the game for the most part. However, there are some E.M.M.I areas that can break the rhythm and be frustrating.</p>\n<p>In addition to these challenges, MercurySteam has also included the possibility of <em>sequence breaks</em> in the game, allowing players to acquire power-ups or face bosses earlier than planned. For instance, with the right combination of Speed Boost and shinespark skill, it’s possible to obtain the Gravity Suit earlier than intended, as demonstrated in the video below.</p>\n<p>\n      <div class=\"gatsby-remark-local-videos\">\n        <video controlsList=\"nodownload\" controls loop preload style=\"width: 100%\" >\n          <source src=\"/be78cceb0948b37238278db5893ca310/sequence-break.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n        </video>\n    </div>\n    </p>\n<p>One aspect of the game that didn’t quite meet my expectations was the variety and style of the areas. Even after playing the game multiple times, I found it difficult to identify which area of the game I was in just by looking at a random room.</p>\n<p>This is in contrast to my experience with Super Metroid, which has such distinctive and memorable room designs that it’s easy to identify which area you’re in. However, I understand that this comparison isn’t entirely fair, as Super Metroid is one of my all-time favorite games and I have spent countless hours playing it at various points in my life.</p>\n<p>It would be great to see more variety and memorable locations in the game. Perhaps we will see this in a future DLC? I certainly hope so.</p>\n<h2 id=\"power-ups\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#power-ups\" aria-label=\"power ups permalink\" class=\"post-headers-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Power-Ups</h2>\n<p>Metroid Dread brings back several classic power-ups from the franchise, such as the Grapple Beam and Screw Attack, as well as introduces new power-ups that I hope will become staples of the franchise, such as the Diffusion Beam and the innovative Flash Shift.</p>\n<p>However, the game also includes some less useful items, such as Spin Boost and Pulse Radar. While the Pulse Radar has some utility, the Spin Boost feels like a unnecessary addition.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/e46bfcf917c7367ea5cfc97c2cdb70a6/please-god-no.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Now let’s focus on the positive aspects of the game. The Flash Shift, a new power-up that allows Samus to perform a horizontal dash, is particularly useful for evading E.M.M.Is and dodging challenging boss attacks.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when combined with shinespark, Flash Shift enables players to move swiftly through the level and solve intricate puzzles that MercurySteam has included in the game. It’s a power-up that truly lets players feel <em>like pros</em> as they navigate through the game.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/1d32f69e8946db8a9af7230c736f15c7/flash-shift.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"bosses\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#bosses\" aria-label=\"bosses permalink\" class=\"post-headers-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Bosses</h2>\n<p>Metroid Dread features a high number of boss encounters and is considered to be one of the hardest games in the franchise. However, many of these encounters involve repeated bosses with minimal variations.</p>\n<p>According to reports, the game was originally intended to have a wider variety of bosses, but due to the need to meet a specific release date, these had to be cut and replaced with repeated bosses.</p>\n<p>Despite this limitation, the boss battles in Metroid Dread are still epic and showcase Samus’s badassery. It’s a shame that there wasn’t more variety in the bosses, but the battles themselves are still exciting.</p>\n<p>The first boss in Metroid Dread serves as a tutorial and sets the stage for the rest of the game with a thrilling battle and impressive cutscenes.</p>\n<p>As players progress through the game, they have the opportunity to engage in <em>sequence breaks</em>, which allow them to acquire certain power-ups and face bosses in different ways. Using these power-ups in these boss encounters can lead to unique interactions that feel like secret discoveries – a classic element of the Metroid series.</p>\n<p>Most bosses have an intended way to defeat them, as well as a secret method that can be unlocked through <em>sequence breaks</em>, shinesparking, or advanced skill.</p>\n<p>The final boss of the game is among the hardest in the franchise and will likely take multiple attempts to defeat. It reminded me of the challenging yet rewarding experience of playing Megaman on my Game Boy Classic, where dying repeatedly was necessary to learn all the patterns.</p>\n<h2 id=\"music\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#music\" aria-label=\"music permalink\" class=\"post-headers-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Music</h2>\n<p>The soundtrack of Metroid Dread is generally good, but some of the tracks feel like they are borrowing heavily from Super Metroid 🤷.</p>\n<p>As a fan of Super Metroid, I have a deep appreciation for its epic music and can recite many of the tracks by heart. Despite playing Metroid Dread multiple times, I still struggle to fully remember any music that isn’t reminiscent of Super Metroid.</p>\n<p>I wish that playing a new Metroid game was like playing a new Zelda game, where the soundtrack is consistently epic and memorable. While some songs in the Zelda series are the same from the first game, the newer tracks are just as good, if not better, than the classic ones. For example, the Spirit Tracks soundtrack gives me chills every time I hear it – it’s truly excellent. 👌👌👌</p>\n<p><div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.42857142857143%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <div class=\"embedVideo-container\"> <iframe title=\"\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1-tJnmNP5ow?rel=0\" class=\"embedVideo-iframe\" style=\"border:0; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \" loading=\"eager\" allowfullscreen=\"\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"></iframe> </div> </div></p>\n<h2 id=\"difficulty-level\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#difficulty-level\" aria-label=\"difficulty level permalink\" class=\"post-headers-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Difficulty Level</h2>\n<p>Metroid Dread is known for its challenging gameplay, but personally, I didn’t find it as difficult as I had read on social media.

As someone who has not played Dark Souls, I can’t say for certain, but in my imagination, those games seem significantly harder.</p>\n<p>Despite the game’s overall challenge, it is quite generous with save rooms and even includes auto-saving for the first time in the franchise.

With the success of the Nintendo Switch, there is a strong possibility that it will become the best-selling Metroid game ever.</p>\n<p>Why should you purchase it? To show Nintendo that there is still a dedicated fan base for the Metroid franchise and to demonstrate that we want more games like Metroid Dread.</p>\n<p>The more successful these games are, the more resources Nintendo will allocate to their development and the more polished they will become. It is possible that one day, MercurySteam will give us a masterpiece like Super Metroid (although some may already consider Metroid Dread to be superior).</p>\n<p>While it may be tempting to hack your Nintendo Switch or download and play the game on an emulator, it is important to resist the urge to pirate games.</p>\n<p>Not only because it’s illegal, and <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/piracy-its-a-crime\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">you wouldn’t steal a car</a>, but doing so leads to fewer sales and fewer opportunities for more games like this to be made. For the price of about $60, you can have hours of entertainment – a relatively small investment compared to the cost of ordering Uber Eats three times. Instead of ordering food this week, consider cooking a healthy meal and using the saved money to purchase Metroid Dread.</p>","fields":{"postHashId":"Z2FtZXN0cnVlbnVsbDIwMjEtMTEtMDdUMDA6MDA6MDAuMDAwWg==","slug":"/2021/2021-11-07-buy-metroid-dread.en/","path":"/blog/games/buy-metroid-dread/","locale":"en"},"readingTime":{"minutes":9.45},"frontmatter":{"path":"buy-metroid-dread","allowComments":true,"title":"Buy Metroid Dread","date":"2021-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","categories":["games"],"tags":["metroid","metroid dread","metroidvania","nintendo","nintendo switch"],"hideExcerpt":false,"subtitle":"Metroid Dread is a challenging game with memorable bosses and new abilities, but it has its caveats"}},"categoryImage":{"childImageSharp":{"original":{"width":1920,"height":1080,"src":"/static/categories_games-45dce0594b4828053338793f21283cda.jpg"}}}},"pageContext":{"postHashId":"Z2FtZXN0cnVlbnVsbDIwMjEtMTEtMDdUMDA6MDA6MDAuMDAwWg==","relatedPosts":[{"fields":{"postHashId":"Z2FtZXN0cnVlbnVsbDIwMjEtMDYtMTZUMDA6MDA6MDAuMDAwWg==","slug":"/2021/2021-06-16-metroid-5-is-finally-announced-19-years-later.en/","path":"/blog/games/metroid-5-is-finally-announced-19-years-later/","locale":"en"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["metroid","metroid dread","metroid 5","nintendo","e3","e3 2021","metroidvania"],"categories":["games"],"allowComments":true,"publishOnMedium":null,"cover":null,"date":"2021-06-16T00:00:00.000Z","id":null,"path":"metroid-5-is-finally-announced-19-years-later","show":true,"title":"Metroid 5 is finally announced, 19 years later","hideExcerpt":null,"subtitle":null}},{"fields":{"postHashId":"Z2FtZXN0cnVlbnVsbDIwMjItMDktMjdUMDA6MDA6MDAuMDAwWg==","slug":"/2022/2022-09-27-e3-2023-dates-revealed.en/","path":"/blog/games/e3-2023-dates-revealed/","locale":"en"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["e3","los angeles","games","nintendo","sony","microsoft"],"categories":["games"],"allowComments":true,"publishOnMedium":false,"cover":null,"date":"2022-09-27T00:00:00.000Z","id":null,"path":"e3-2023-dates-revealed","show":true,"title":"E3 2023 dates revealed","hideExcerpt":false,"subtitle":"LET'S GOOOOOOOO"}},{"fields":{"postHashId":"Z2FtZXN0cnVlbnVsbDIwMjItMDYtMDFUMDA6MDA6MDAuMDAwWg==","slug":"/2022/2022-06-01-10-years-anniversary-of-my-first-e3.en/","path":"/blog/games/10-years-anniversary-of-my-first-e3/","locale":"en"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["e3","e3 2012","games","los angeles","lacc","convention center","nintendo","sony","microsoft","gameblast","media","journalism"],"categories":["games"],"allowComments":true,"publishOnMedium":false,"cover":null,"date":"2022-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","id":null,"path":"10-years-anniversary-of-my-first-e3","show":true,"title":"10 years anniversary of my first E3","hideExcerpt":false,"subtitle":"10 years ago today I was embarking on a journey to my first E3 conference."}},{"fields":{"postHashId":"Z2FtZXN0cnVlbnVsbDIwMjEtMDctMTRUMDA6MDA6MDAuMDAwWg==","slug":"/2021/2021-07-14-creating-my-dream-skyward-sword-hd-switch-accessories.en/","path":"/blog/games/creating-my-dream-skyward-sword-hd-switch-accessories/","locale":"en"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["general","zelda","games","accessories","skyward sword","nintendo switch","thingiverse","fiverr","3d"],"categories":["games"],"allowComments":true,"publishOnMedium":null,"cover":null,"date":"2021-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","id":null,"path":"creating-my-dream-skyward-sword-hd-switch-accessories","show":true,"title":"Creating my dream Skyward Sword HD Switch accessories","hideExcerpt":null,"subtitle":null}},{"fields":{"postHashId":"Z2FtZXN0cnVlbnVsbDIwMjEtMDctMDZUMDA6MDA6MDAuMDAwWg==","slug":"/2021/2021-07-06-hiding-parts-of-the-map-on-phaser-js-game-devlog-21.en/","path":"/blog/games/hiding-parts-of-the-map-on-phaser-js-game-devlog-21/","locale":"en"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["coding","games","javascript","phaser","phaser 3","game devlog","gamedev","skate platformer","super ollie vs pebble corp","webpack","tiled","metroidvania"],"categories":["games"],"allowComments":true,"publishOnMedium":null,"cover":null,"date":"2021-07-06T00:00:00.000Z","id":null,"path":"hiding-parts-of-the-map-on-phaser-js-game-devlog-21","show":true,"title":"Hiding parts of the map on Phaser JS -

WHAT!?</p>\n<p>The game, developed by Spanish company MercurySteam (known for their work on the Metroid: Samus Returns remake of Metroid II: Return of Samus), was slated for release later in the year, much to the delight of fans.</p>\n<p>While Metroid: Samus Returns received mixed reviews from critics, I personally found the game to be enjoyable, though not particularly groundbreaking. Some of the level design choices didn’t quite appeal to me, but I was still thrilled to see the return of 2D Metroid gameplay.</p>\n<p>When the package for Metroid Dread arrived at my house, I was so excited to play the game that I even forgot to film an unboxing video for <a href=\"https://playreplay.com.br/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">PlayReplay</a> 😅!</p>\n<p>After a satisfying weekend of gameplay, I completed Metroid Dread with a total of 11 hours and 30 minutes played and 87% of items collected. While it may not be a world record, I’m proud of my progress and the amount of items I was able to collect.</p>\n<p>Now, let’s get started with my review of the game.</p>\n<h2 id=\"level-design\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#level-design\" aria-label=\"level design permalink\" class=\"post-headers-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Level Design</h2>\n<p>Metroid Dread features 8 interconnected areas, connected by tunnels, elevators, and teleports. These connections are seamlessly integrated, creating a believable alien world with both wild and technological elements, and ample opportunities for hidden secrets to be unveiled in every corner.</p>\n<p>MercurySteam managed to capture exactly what makes a Metroid game a Metroid game, and many times I thought I was taking a super secret path and going off the intended path, only to be pleasantly surprised when I ended up exactly where I was supposed to go and found some main power-up or boss. The game is outstanding at using level design to guide you to the right path.</p>\n<p>Metroid Dread is full of secrets and items that will keep players searching and challenged as they try to figure out how to obtain them. I personally encountered many items that initially seemed out of reach due to my lack of certain power-ups, only to later realize that I simply needed to <em><strong>git gud</strong></em> and use shinespark creatively to get them. MercurySteam deserves credit for this aspect of the game. 👏 MercurySteam 👏.</p>\n<p>Overall, the balance of item and boss acquisition is well-paced and keeps players engaged with the game for the most part. However, there are some E.M.M.I areas that can break the rhythm and be frustrating.</p>\n<p>In addition to these challenges, MercurySteam has also included the possibility of <em>sequence breaks</em> in the game, allowing players to acquire power-ups or face bosses earlier than planned. For instance, with the right combination of Speed Boost and shinespark skill, it’s possible to obtain the Gravity Suit earlier than intended, as demonstrated in the video below.</p>\n<p>\n      </p><div class=\"gatsby-remark-local-videos\">\n        <video controlslist=\"nodownload\" controls=\"\" loop=\"\" preload=\"\" style=\"width: 100%\">\n          <source src=\"/be78cceb0948b37238278db5893ca310/sequence-break.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n        </video>\n    </div>\n    <p></p>\n<p>One aspect of the game that didn’t quite meet my expectations was the variety and style of the areas. Even after playing the game multiple times, I found it difficult to identify which area of the game I was in just by looking at a random room.</p>\n<p>This is in contrast to my experience with Super Metroid, which has such distinctive and memorable room designs that it’s easy to identify which area you’re in. However, I understand that this comparison isn’t entirely fair, as Super Metroid is one of my all-time favorite games and I have spent countless hours playing it at various points in my life.</p>\n<p>It would be great to see more variety and memorable locations in the game. Perhaps we will see this in a future DLC? I certainly hope so.</p>\n<h2 id=\"power-ups\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#power-ups\" aria-label=\"power ups permalink\" class=\"post-headers-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Power-Ups</h2>\n<p>Metroid Dread brings back several classic power-ups from the franchise, such as the Grapple Beam and Screw Attack, as well as introduces new power-ups that I hope will become staples of the franchise, such as the Diffusion Beam and the innovative Flash Shift.</p>\n<p>However, the game also includes some less useful items, such as Spin Boost and Pulse Radar. While the Pulse Radar has some utility, the Spin Boost feels like a unnecessary addition.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/e46bfcf917c7367ea5cfc97c2cdb70a6/please-god-no.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Now let’s focus on the positive aspects of the game. The Flash Shift, a new power-up that allows Samus to perform a horizontal dash, is particularly useful for evading E.M.M.Is and dodging challenging boss attacks.</p>\n<p>Additionally, when combined with shinespark, Flash Shift enables players to move swiftly through the level and solve intricate puzzles that MercurySteam has included in the game. It’s a power-up that truly lets players feel <em>like pros</em> as they navigate through the game.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/1d32f69e8946db8a9af7230c736f15c7/flash-shift.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"bosses\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#bosses\" aria-label=\"bosses permalink\" class=\"post-headers-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Bosses</h2>\n<p>Metroid Dread features a high number of boss encounters and is considered to be one of the hardest games in the franchise. However, many of these encounters involve repeated bosses with minimal variations.</p>\n<p>According to reports, the game was originally intended to have a wider variety of bosses, but due to the need to meet a specific release date, these had to be cut and replaced with repeated bosses.</p>\n<p>Despite this limitation, the boss battles in Metroid Dread are still epic and showcase Samus’s badassery. It’s a shame that there wasn’t more variety in the bosses, but the battles themselves are still exciting.</p>\n<p>The first boss in Metroid Dread serves as a tutorial and sets the stage for the rest of the game with a thrilling battle and impressive cutscenes.</p>\n<p>As players progress through the game, they have the opportunity to engage in <em>sequence breaks</em>, which allow them to acquire certain power-ups and face bosses in different ways. Using these power-ups in these boss encounters can lead to unique interactions that feel like secret discoveries – a classic element of the Metroid series.</p>\n<p>Most bosses have an intended way to defeat them, as well as a secret method that can be unlocked through <em>sequence breaks</em>, shinesparking, or advanced skill.</p>\n<p>The final boss of the game is among the hardest in the franchise and will likely take multiple attempts to defeat. It reminded me of the challenging yet rewarding experience of playing Megaman on my Game Boy Classic, where dying repeatedly was necessary to learn all the patterns.</p>\n<h2 id=\"music\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#music\" aria-label=\"music permalink\" class=\"post-headers-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Music</h2>\n<p>The soundtrack of Metroid Dread is generally good, but some of the tracks feel like they are borrowing heavily from Super Metroid 🤷.</p>\n<p>As a fan of Super Metroid, I have a deep appreciation for its epic music and can recite many of the tracks by heart. Despite playing Metroid Dread multiple times, I still struggle to fully remember any music that isn’t reminiscent of Super Metroid.</p>\n<p>I wish that playing a new Metroid game was like playing a new Zelda game, where the soundtrack is consistently epic and memorable. While some songs in the Zelda series are the same from the first game, the newer tracks are just as good, if not better, than the classic ones. For example, the Spirit Tracks soundtrack gives me chills every time I hear it – it’s truly excellent. 👌👌👌</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.42857142857143%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\"> <div class=\"embedVideo-container\"> <iframe title=\"\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1-tJnmNP5ow?rel=0\" class=\"embedVideo-iframe\" style=\"border:0; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \" loading=\"eager\" allowfullscreen=\"\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-popups\"></iframe> </div> </div><p></p>\n<h2 id=\"difficulty-level\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#difficulty-level\" aria-label=\"difficulty level permalink\" class=\"post-headers-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Difficulty Level</h2>\n<p>Metroid Dread is known for its challenging gameplay, but personally, I didn’t find it as difficult as I had read on social media. While I consider myself a big fan of the franchise, I have never been particularly skilled at playing the games.</p>\n<p>Many players have compared the game’s difficulty to that of titles from developer FromSoftware, specifically the Souls series. As someone who has not played Dark Souls, I can’t say for certain, but in my imagination, those games seem significantly harder.</p>\n<p>Despite the game’s overall challenge, it is quite generous with save rooms and even includes auto-saving for the first time in the franchise. If you die during a boss battle, the game automatically saves and you can immediately return to the boss room to try again.</p>\n<p><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1024px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"metroid dread game over\" title=\"metroid dread game over\" src=\"/static/141104f962f62dbda2c37d2c6e8fec68/42a19/metroid-dread-game-over.png\" srcset=\"/static/141104f962f62dbda2c37d2c6e8fec68/e3135/metroid-dread-game-over.png 256w,\n/static/141104f962f62dbda2c37d2c6e8fec68/06341/metroid-dread-game-over.png 512w,\n/static/141104f962f62dbda2c37d2c6e8fec68/42a19/metroid-dread-game-over.png 1024w,\n/static/141104f962f62dbda2c37d2c6e8fec68/bbbf7/metroid-dread-game-over.png 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n    </span></p>\n<h2 id=\"why-should-you-buy-it\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#why-should-you-buy-it\" aria-label=\"why should you buy it permalink\" class=\"post-headers-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Why should you buy it?</h2>\n<p>The Metroid franchise has struggled to find success in the past decade, leading to the emergence of many indie Metroidvania games that pay tribute to the genre-defining original.</p>\n<p>Despite its flaws, Metroid Dread is a great game and represents a step in the right direction for the franchise. With the success of the Nintendo Switch, there is a strong possibility that it will become the best-selling Metroid game ever.</p>\n<p>Why should you purchase it? To show Nintendo that there is still a dedicated fan base for the Metroid franchise and to demonstrate that we want more games like Metroid Dread.</p>\n<p>The more successful these games are, the more resources Nintendo will allocate to their development and the more polished they will become. It is possible that one day, MercurySteam will give us a masterpiece like Super Metroid (although some may already consider Metroid Dread to be superior).</p>\n<p>While it may be tempting to hack your Nintendo Switch or download and play the game on an emulator, it is important to resist the urge to pirate games.</p>\n<p>Not only because it’s illegal, and <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/piracy-its-a-crime\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">you wouldn’t steal a car</a>, but doing so leads to fewer sales and fewer opportunities for more games like this to be made.

Foi um grande sucesso imediatamente, o Twitter estava bombando com todo mundo falando sobre Metroid Dread sem parar, e o melhor é que o jogo seria lançado no mesmo ano!!! Ahhhhhh!!!!</p>\n<p>O jogo foi desenvolvido pela MercurySteam, uma empresa espanhola que também trabalhou no jogo Metroid: Samus Returns, o remake do segundo Metroid lançado para o Game Boy, Metroid II: Return of Samus.</p>\n<p>Metroid: Samus Returns teve opiniões divididas entre os críticos, eu joguei e achei o jogo maneirinho, mas nada de mais. O jogo teve algumas escolhas de level design que eu particularmente não concordo muito, mas pelo menos Metroid 2D estava de volta e isso ja foi ótimo!</p>\n<p>Passam-se alguns anos, e Metroid Dread está aqui! No dia que o pacote do Metroid Dread chegou aqui em casa, eu estava tão ansioso para jogar o jogo que eu até esqueci de fazer o unboxing para a <a href=\"https://playreplay.com.br/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">PlayReplay</a> 😅</p>\n<p>Depois de um longo fim de semana, eu terminei o jogo com 11 horas e 30 minutos e 87% dos itens coletados. Não é bem um recorde mundial, mas foi um tempo bom com uma boa porcentagem de itens coletados.</p>\n<p>Bom, chega de lenga-lenga, vamos começar a análise do Metroid Dread.</p>\n<h2 id=\"level-design\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#level-design\" aria-label=\"level design permalink\" class=\"post-headers-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Level Design</h2>\n<p>Metroid Dread tem 8 áreas diferentes que são interconectadas por túneis, elevadores e teletransportes. Todas essas conexões são bem orgánicas e vendem bem a idéia de mundo alienígena com partes selvagens e tecnologicas, e claro, muitos segredos escondidos em todos os cantos.</p>\n<p>A MercurySteam conseguiu capturar exatamente o que faz um jogo Metroid ser um jogo Metroid, e muitas vezes eu achava que estava pegando um caminho super secreto e indo fora do caminho normal, e para minha surpresa eu acabava exatamente onde eu deveria ir e encontrava algum power-up principal ou algum chefão. O jogo faz um excelente trabalho em te levar para o lugar certo usando técnicas de level design.</p>\n<p>O jogo é cheio de segredos e itens escondidos em todos os cantos, e vários desses itens vão te fazer perder horas tentando entender como faz para consegui-los. Eu passei por muitos itens que eu achava que eram impossíveis de pegar porque eu ainda não tinha adquirido algum power-up, para depois descobrir que eu simplesmente tinha que <em><strong>git gud</strong></em> e usar o shinespark de uma maneira criativa para conseguir os itens. 👏 MercurySteam 👏.</p>\n<p>O ritmo onde você encontra itens e chefões está muito bem balanceado e te mantém engajado com o jogo quase o tempo todo, salvo algumas areas dos E.M.M.I que quebram às vezes o ritmo do jogo e me deixavam um pouco frustrado.</p>\n<p>A MercurySteam também trabalhou pesado para incluir a possibilidade de <em>sequence breaks</em> no jogo, que possibilita adquirir power-ups ou enfrentar chefões fora da sua hora planejada.

Nesse enorme intervalo de tempo, muitos jogos independentes de Metroidvania foram lançados, e todos eles respeitam o jogo que criou o gênero: Metroid.</p>\n<p>Metroid Dread está longe de ser perfeito, tem suas falhas, mas não deixa de ser um ótimo jogo. Eu acho que o caminho que a MercurySteam está tomando na franquia é o caminho certo, e com o sucesso do Nintendo Switch, há uma grande chance de que este seja o jogo Metroid mais vendido de todos os tempos.</p>\n<p>Por que você deve comprá-lo? Para mostrar à Nintendo que nos importamos, para mostrar a eles que amamos a franquia Metroid e queremos mais jogos como Metroid Dread. Quanto mais sucesso esses jogos obtiverem, mais dinheiro a Nintendo colocará em seu desenvolvimento e mais polidos serão. Talvez um dia, o MercurySteam nos dê uma obra-prima como Super Metroid - e eu sei que muitas pessoas já pensam que Metroid Dread é melhor que Super Metroid… mas… eu ainda não… 😬</p>\n<p>É super fácil hackear seu Nintendo Switch ou simplesmente baixar Metroid Dread e jogá-lo em um emulador, mas <strong>NÃO FAÇA ISSO</strong>. A pirataria de jogos só levará a menos vendas e, menos chances de conseguirmos mais jogos como esse. Eu sei que R$300 é muito dinheiro, mas para um jogo que pode te dar horas de diversão, vale a pena. Eu tenho certeza que muita gente gasta muito mais que isso por mês com Uber e iFood, então da próxima vez que você sentir preguiça, economize algum dinheiro, não peça comida e cozinhe alguma refeição saudável - e depois compre Metroid Dread 😊</p>","fields":{"postHashId":"Z2FtZXN0cnVlbnVsbDIwMjEtMTEtMDdUMDA6MDA6MDAuMDAwWg==","slug":"/2021/2021-11-07-compre-metroid-dread.pt-br/","path":"/blog/games/compre-metroid-dread/","locale":"pt-br"},"rawMarkdownBody":"Finalmente, o jogo mais aguardado da minha vida, Metroid Dread, está aqui! Depois de tantas notícias, rumores e até mesmo teorias da conspiração ao longo dos anos, eu finalmente tenho o jogo em mãos. Não escrevo uma análise de um jogo há mais de 10 anos - a última foi, de fato, para Metroid: Other M - então é uma ótima oportunidade para voltar a ativa e escrever uma nova análise para mais um jogo da franquia Metroid.\r\n\r\nAtenção, pois **este post conterá muitos spoilers**, então leia por sua conta e risco!\r\n\r\n## Contexto\r\nEm 2002, a Nintendo lançou o Metroid Fusion, uma sequência direta do amado Super Metroid. Como proprietário de um Game Boy Advance com alguns jogos, esperei ansiosamente pelo lançamento de Metroid Fusion, que caiu entre meu aniversário e o Natal.\r\n\r\nA minha empolgação para o jogo era tanta, que comprei imediatamente um exemplar da revista Nintendo World, que trazia um passo a passo completo do jogo, assim que a vi na banca. A empolgação pelo jogo era tanta e não consegui resistir à tentação de ter a revista em minhas mãos.\r\n\r\n![](../../uploads/blog/2021/11/nintendo_world_52.png)\r\n\r\nPapai Noel sabia que eu fui um bom menino naquele ano, então eu ganhei o jogo no Natal e consegui terminá-lo antes do Ano Novo - sem usar o detonado da Nintendo World, prometo!\r\n\r\nMetroid Fusion é bastante linear em comparação com os outros jogos da franquia, mas por causa disso, foi capaz de nos dar um jogo repleto de história e quebra-cabeças malucos com shinespark.\r\n\r\nDois anos depois, a Nintendo lançou Metroid: Zero Mission, um remake do primeiro Metroid. Foi com certeza um ótimo momento para ser um fã da franquia, mas muitos fãs estavam contando os dias para finalmente ver uma sequência de Metroid Fusion. Rapaz, mal sabíamos...\r\n\r\nPor dezenove anos, Metroid Fusion foi o último jogo Metroid canônico na linha do tempo, e não tínhamos ideia do que tinha acontecido com a Samus... até agora.\r\n\r\n## Introdução\r\nA Nintendo praticamente quebrou a internet quando anunciou Metroid Dread durante a E3 deste ano. Foi um grande sucesso imediatamente, o Twitter estava bombando com todo mundo falando sobre Metroid Dread sem parar, e o melhor é que o jogo seria lançado no mesmo ano!!! Ahhhhhh!!!!\r\n\r\nO jogo foi desenvolvido pela MercurySteam, uma empresa espanhola que também trabalhou no jogo Metroid: Samus Returns, o remake do segundo Metroid lançado para o Game Boy, Metroid II: Return of Samus.\r\n\r\nMetroid: Samus Returns teve opiniões divididas entre os críticos, eu joguei e achei o jogo maneirinho, mas nada de mais. O jogo teve algumas escolhas de level design que eu particularmente não concordo muito, mas pelo menos Metroid 2D estava de volta e isso ja foi ótimo!\r\n\r\nPassam-se alguns anos, e Metroid Dread está aqui! No dia que o pacote do Metroid Dread chegou aqui em casa, eu estava tão ansioso para jogar o jogo que eu até esqueci de fazer o unboxing para a [PlayReplay](https://playreplay.com.br/) 😅\r\n\r\nDepois de um longo fim de semana, eu terminei o jogo com 11 horas e 30 minutos e 87% dos itens coletados. Não é bem um recorde mundial, mas foi um tempo bom com uma boa porcentagem de itens coletados.\r\n\r\nBom, chega de lenga-lenga, vamos começar a análise do Metroid Dread.\r\n\r\n## Level Design\r\nMetroid Dread tem 8 áreas diferentes que são interconectadas por túneis, elevadores e teletransportes. Todas essas conexões são bem orgánicas e vendem bem a idéia de mundo alienígena com partes selvagens e tecnologicas, e claro, muitos segredos escondidos em todos os cantos.\r\n\r\nA MercurySteam conseguiu capturar exatamente o que faz um jogo Metroid ser um jogo Metroid, e muitas vezes eu achava que estava pegando um caminho super secreto e indo fora do caminho normal, e para minha surpresa eu acabava exatamente onde eu deveria ir e encontrava algum power-up principal ou algum chefão. O jogo faz um excelente trabalho em te levar para o lugar certo usando técnicas de level design.\r\n\r\nO jogo é cheio de segredos e itens escondidos em todos os cantos, e vários desses itens vão te fazer perder horas tentando entender como faz para consegui-los. Eu passei por muitos itens que eu achava que eram impossíveis de pegar porque eu ainda não tinha adquirido algum power-up, para depois descobrir que eu simplesmente tinha que _**git gud**_ e usar o shinespark de uma maneira criativa para conseguir os itens. 👏 MercurySteam 👏.\r\n\r\nO ritmo onde você encontra itens e chefões está muito bem balanceado e te mantém engajado com o jogo quase o tempo todo, salvo algumas areas dos E.M.M.I que quebram às vezes o ritmo do jogo e me deixavam um pouco frustrado.\r\n\r\nA MercurySteam também trabalhou pesado para incluir a possibilidade de _sequence breaks_ no jogo, que possibilita adquirir power-ups ou enfrentar chefões fora da sua hora planejada. Por exemplo, no vídeo abaixo é possível conseguir a Gravity Suit antes do planejado se você tiver Speed Boost e bastante habilidade com o shinespark.\r\n\r\n![](../../uploads/blog/2021/11/sequence-break.mp4)\r\n\r\nAgora, em termos de artes e estilos das áreas, o jogo deixou um pouco a desejar. Eu finalizei o jogo quatro vezes, e ainda assim não sei dizer exatamente em qual área do jogo eu estou se eu simplesmente olhar pra um sala aleatória, o que é totalmente diferente do que acontece quando eu estou jogando Super Metroid, porém, eu sei que essa comparação não é justa, pois Super Metroid é um dos meus jogos favoritos e eu nem sei dizer quantas horas eu passei jogando ele em todas as fases da minha vida.\r\n\r\nAinda assim eu sinto que Metroid Dread poderia ter tido salas com designs mais unicos e/ou mais monumentais.\r\n\r\n## Power-Ups\r\nMetroid Dread traz diversos power-ups clássicos da franquia, como o Grapple Beam e o Screw Attack, e introduz novos power-ups que eu espero que se tornem parte da franquia daqui pra frente, como o Diffusion Beam e o maravilhoso Flash Shift.\r\n\r\nPor outro lado, o jogo também traz itens meios inúteis, como o Spin Boost e o Pulse Radar. Para falar a verdade o Pulse Radar até que é ok, mas o Spin Boost...\r\n\r\n![](../../uploads/blog/2021/11/please-god-no.gif)\r\n\r\nMas vamos falar de coisa boa, vamos falar ~~da Tekpix~~ do Flash Shift, um power-up novo que permite que a Samus faça um dash horizontal, ótimo para fugir de E.M.M.Is ou de ataques chatos de chefões.\r\n\r\nAlém disso, combinado com o shinespark, o Flash Shift possibilita se mover rapidamente pela fase _like a pro_ e permite resolver uns puzzles incríveis que a MercurySteam fez para gente.\r\n\r\n![](../../uploads/blog/2021/11/flash-shift.gif)\r\n\r\n## Chefões\r\nMetroid Dread tem muitos chefões e é um dos mais difíceis da franquia. Infelizmente, muitos desses encontros são chefões repetidos com pequenas ou nenhumas variações.\r\n\r\nEu li em algum lugar que Metroid Dread tinha um escopo maior e teve que ser reduzido para estar pronto para sua data de lançamento, então parece que o jogo deveria ter uma variedade maior de chefões, mas eles tiveram que ser reduzidos e substituídos pelos mesmos chefões repetidamente.\r\n\r\nEssa é a má notícia. A boa notícia é que as batalhas dos chefões são bastante épicas, e Samus está mais foda do que nunca.\r\n\r\nO primeiro chefão é praticamente um tutorial e já prepara o terreno para o que está por vir no jogo com uma grande batalha e _cutscenes_ impressionantes.\r\n\r\nMais tarde, você tem a chance de fazer uma _sequence breaks_ (planejada pela MercurySteam), o que leva você a ter certos power-ups em certos chefões, e usando esses power-ups nesses chefões você terá diferentes interações que fazem você se sentir como se tivesse acabado de descobrir um segredo - coisas clássicas de Metroid.\r\n\r\nA maioria dos chefões tem uma maneira \"oficial\" de derrotar, e uma maneira secreta, que pode ser desbloqueada com uma _sequence breaks_, usando o shinespark ou sendo muito sinistro nas suas habilidades.\r\n\r\nO último chefão é provavelmente um dos mais difíceis da franquia, e definitivamente levará várias tentativas para vencê-lo. Me fez lembrar como era jogar Megaman no meu Game Boy Classic. Apenas morra, morra e morra para finalmente aprender todos os padrões e finalmente derrota-lo.\r\n\r\n## Música\r\nA trilha sonora de Metroid Dread é boa, mas claro que é boa, afinal, várias faixas são simplesmente copiadas de Super Metroid 🤷.\r\n\r\nMais uma vez, posso ser tendencioso, mas conheço todas as músicas de Super Metroid de cor, são tão épicas que dói, e para Metroid Dread, mesmo depois de finalizar o jogo quatro vezes, ainda não consigo me lembrar completamente de nenhuma música que seja não copiada de Super Metroid.\r\n\r\nEu gostaria que jogar um novo Metroid fosse como jogar um novo jogo Zelda, onde a trilha sonora é sempre incrivelmente épica. Claro, algumas das músicas são as mesmas dos primeiros Zelda, mas as novas faixas são tão boas ou até melhores que as clássicas. Eu ainda me arrepio com a trilha sonora de Spirit Tracks. A sério. A trilha sonora desse jogo é simplesmente 👌👌👌\r\n\r\n`youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-tJnmNP5ow`\r\n\r\n## Nível de Dificuldade\r\nO jogo é difícil, mas eu sinceramente não achei tão difícil como eu li no Twitter, e eu estou longe de ser um bom jogador de Metroid, apesar de ser muito fã da franquia, eu nunca fui muito bom jogando.\r\n\r\nMuitas pessoas compararam a dificuldade do jogo com os jogos da FromSoftware, e bom, eu nunca joguei Dark Souls, então não sei dizer, mas na minha cabeça eu penso que os jogos Souls são muito mais difíceis.\r\n\r\nApesar do nível de dificuldade do jogo, ele é bem generoso com salas para salvar o jogo e inclusive auto-saves pela primeira vez na franquia.

Nesse enorme intervalo de tempo, muitos jogos independentes de Metroidvania foram lançados, e todos eles respeitam o jogo que criou o gênero: Metroid.\r\n\r\nMetroid Dread está longe de ser perfeito, tem suas falhas, mas não deixa de ser um ótimo jogo. Eu acho que o caminho que a MercurySteam está tomando na franquia é o caminho certo, e com o sucesso do Nintendo Switch, há uma grande chance de que este seja o jogo Metroid mais vendido de todos os tempos.\r\n\r\nPor que você deve comprá-lo? Para mostrar à Nintendo que nos importamos, para mostrar a eles que amamos a franquia Metroid e queremos mais jogos como Metroid Dread. Quanto mais sucesso esses jogos obtiverem, mais dinheiro a Nintendo colocará em seu desenvolvimento e mais polidos serão. Talvez um dia, o MercurySteam nos dê uma obra-prima como Super Metroid - e eu sei que muitas pessoas já pensam que Metroid Dread é melhor que Super Metroid... mas... eu ainda não... 😬\r\n\r\nÉ super fácil hackear seu Nintendo Switch ou simplesmente baixar Metroid Dread e jogá-lo em um emulador, mas **NÃO FAÇA ISSO**. A pirataria de jogos só levará a menos vendas e, menos chances de conseguirmos mais jogos como esse. Eu sei que R$300 é muito dinheiro, mas para um jogo que pode te dar horas de diversão, vale a pena. Eu tenho certeza que muita gente gasta muito mais que isso por mês com Uber e iFood, então da próxima vez que você sentir preguiça, economize algum dinheiro, não peça comida e cozinhe alguma refeição saudável - e depois compre Metroid Dread 😊\r\n","frontmatter":{"tags":["metroid","metroid dread","metroidvania","nintendo","nintendo switch"],"categories":["games"],"allowComments":true,"publishOnMedium":false,"cover":null,"date":"2021-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","id":null,"path":"compre-metroid-dread","show":true,"title":"Compre Metroid Dread","hideExcerpt":false,"subtitle":"Metroid Dread é um jogo desafiador com chefes memoráveis e novas habilidades, mas também tem suas desvantagens."}},"next":{"excerpt":"On Phaser 3 you can pre-load your assets in a function…","html":"<p>On Phaser 3 you can pre-load your assets in a function called <code class=\"language-text\">preload</code> so they are ready to use when the function <code class=\"language-text\">create</code> starts.
