Much like Miyamoto once said “Ocarina of Time is the very first story!“. It turns out that we recently discovered that it is not quite like that: During this year’s E3, Skyward Sword, the new game in the Zelda series for Wii, was revealed.</p>\n<p>What happens is that in this game it is revealed how the Master Sword becomes Master Sword, and seeing that the Master Sword already existed in the Ocarina of Time, obviously Skyward Sword comes from all Zeldas. Which made it all very problematic, as I spent hours and hours putting the timeline together, and often some stories made perfect sense to stay before Ocarina of Time, but I couldn’t because of the simple fact that Ocarina of Time was the first Zelda , well, no more.</p>\n<p>At least Skyward Sword arrived already explaining A LOT, even with so little revealed. The fact that Skyward Sword can become Master Sword explains perfectly why Picori Sword and Lokomo Sword look so much like Master Sword - Somehow Master Sword ends up becoming Picori / Lokomo Sword.</p>\n<p>As few details were revealed about Skyward Sword, I prefer not to think about the timeline for now, even though despite explaining some things, Skyward Sword brought much more doubts than clarity.</p>\n<p>So I’m releasing below the post I intended to do on Zelda’s timeline. Get ready for a huge <a href=\"http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Wall_of_Text\" title=\"Wall of Text\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">WOT</a>!</p>\n<p>After researching A LOT, I completed my vision on Zelda’s timeline. I know that many have already done the same, including the GameTrailer website, but with each game released, gaps in these theories are created.</p>\n<p>I’m going to show you my own theory about Zelda’s timeline, of all the Zeldas I’ve played and everything I’ve studied about, I’m satisfied with this being the “official” timeline for me. First of all, one thing we need to understand is that Hyrule is not the name of a world, as ours is Earth.</p>\n<p>It is just a continent of a world that has not yet been revealed, just as Labrynna and Holodrum from Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons are continents in the same way. Another important thing is to know that the game’s hero name is not necessarily Link, so much so that you can choose the name every game start.</p>\n<p>Right then, the first thing we know about the Zelda universe, is the creation of Hyrule by the three Goddesses, Din, Nayru and Farore (In the act of creating the world of Hyrule, multiple universes were created).</p>\n<p>Then there was the great war in Hyrule, known as the Hyrulean Civil War to see who had the power of the Triforce, the war ended with the Triforce in the hands of the Royal Family of Hyrule, thus beginning the events of Ocarina of Time.</p>\n<p>Despite Aonuma’s hasty announcement about Four Swords for GBA, in which he claims that this game is the first on Zelda’s timeline, I rely more on the quotes in which he really was part of the game’s story development, not as a producer, like he was on Four Swords. After the events in Ocarina of Time, we have the famous split timeline, in which one Link goes back in time and tells Princess Zelda everything about Ganondorf and his plans, and in the other he continues in the future devastated by Ganondorf’s power.</p>\n<p>We will now continue with the timeline in which Link would remain an adult. After the world was destroyed by Ganondorf, the events mentioned in the backstory of Wind Waker occur: The king and the people of Hyrule asked the Gods to flood the world, afraid of the evil power of Ganon, who somehow resurrected and for some reason. reason was not prevented by Link.</p>\n<p>I don’t know this story will turn out to be some Zelda game, but I’ll leave a question at that point. Hundreds of years have passed and a new Link is born, he receives an outfit from his grandmother on his birthday, as a ritual of waiting for the hero to return from the past. These are the events of Wind Waker. This Link meets a pirate named Tetra who later reveals himself to be the reincarnation of the princess of Hyrule, Zelda and the King of Red Lions is revealed to be the former king who flooded Hyrule, Daphnes Nohansen Hyrule.</p>\n<p>After collecting the pieces of the Triforce of Courage and killing Ganondorf, Zelda and Link are given the mission to seek a new land to rule. Link and Tetra go in search of new lands, and are faced with a ghost ship, causing the events of Phantom Hourglass, where Link wakes up in an unknown land and Tetra is missing. Determined to find Tetra, Link goes on yet another adventure, where in the end it is revealed that Link was not in his world, but in the World of the Ocean King.</p>\n<p>Upon returning to their own world, the sailors on Tetra’s ship claim that the two were unconscious on the fanstasma ship for just 10 minutes, so Link looks in his pocket and finds the Phantom Hourglass. An adventure in a parallel universe or just a dream?</p>\n<p>It doesn’t really matter, as Spirit Tracks events follow. Many quotes in the game itself show that this new realm was found by Link and Zelda’s ancestors, who named it Hyrule, because of the old realm forgotten by people. One weird thing about Spirit Tracks is the Lokomo Sword, which was designed by the Gods to humans to defeat the bad in the past. She has an incredible resemblance to the Master Sword. Would it be itself with a different name, or does each land have its own weapon to fight evil?</p>\n<p>This remains open, everyone thinks what they want. Now, after Spirit Tracks, not much is known, so I’m going to fit a game that starts in a game that doesn’t know much about the past: Minish Cap. But between Minish Cap and Spirit Tracks I would like to put the future Zelda for Wii.</p>\n<p>Not that much is already known about the game, but what everything indicates is that it will be a game that will show a lot about Master Sword, and perhaps explain the Master Sword / Picori Sword transition. In Minish Cap, a new villain appears: Vaati.</p>\n<p>A sorcerer who only wants to become more powerful, and for that he needs the “Light Power” (triforce of wisdom?) That Princess Zelda has. Link once again has the mission to save Princess Zelda and on the way to his adventure, he forges the Four Sword and defeats Vaati.</p>\n<p>Since this Zelda doesn’t comment on Triforce or Ganon, the only thing we can imagine is that it is hundreds of years after Spirit Tracks, but one thing is certain: Minish have always existed. In a quote from the game, it says that the Minish have fun hiding items and breaks under rocks and grass around the world. After Minish Cap, obviously comes the Game Boy Advance’s Four Swords, in which Vaati manages to escape his prison and kidnaps Princess Zelda. Link goes after it to rescue Zelda and reseals Vaati on the Four Sword.</p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter comes the Four Swords Adventures, for Game Cube, in which Vaati is released again and at the end of the game it is revealed that Vaati was just being manipulated by Ganon, Link defeats Vaati and Ganon and saddles Ganon on the Four Sword. Here ends the timeline of the adult link for Ocarina of Time. Now let’s go back to the beginning of everything: Ocarina of Time’s Link goes back in time and tells Princess Zelda everything about Ganondorf and his plans and Ganondorf is sentenced to death.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Link says goodbye to Zelda as he goes in search of his companion Navi, who left him at the end of Ocarina of Time. While looking for Navi, Link gets lost in Lost Woods and is approached by a Skull Kid, who steals his Ocarina of Time and Epona, while following him, Link is teleported to another world, a universe parallel to Hyrule. Once there, Link learns that the moon is about to fall, and Link has only three days to stop the moon.</p>\n<p>At the end of the third day, Link uses the Ocarina of Time to go back in time and continue his adventure. At the end of the game, it is not very clear whether or not Link returns to Hyrule, but there are theories that he appears in the Twilight Princess in the form of Stalfo, I will talk about this later.</p>\n<p>Returning to the timeline, a while passed by Ocarina of Time and a tribe of dark magicians known as Dark Interlopers tried to get the Triforce using the power of the Fused Shadow but were stopped by the Light Spirits. Again, I don’t know if there will be a Zelda based on this story, so I’ll leave a question here. Hundreds of years later, the events of Twilight Princess take place, in which Ganondorf tries to dominate Hyrule again, but this time manipulating Zant, a being of the Twilight Realm, which I also believe to be the Dark World, as well as many.</p>\n<p>After defeating Zant, Link battles Ganondorf and defeats him with the Master Sword. After the events of Twilight Princess, many hundreds of years pass, and for some reason, Triforce is separated into several pieces. After the events of Twilight Princess, the A Link to The Past begins, in which the Imprisoning War is introduced, which is not known for sure if the events occurred in Twilight Princess or Ocarina of Time. Link to the Past begins on a night when Link wakes up to the telepathic cry for help made by Zelda, who tries to call someone to her rescue, upon hearing the words Link’s Uncle takes his shield and sword and goes after it to rescue the Princess. Link gets up from his bed and goes after his uncle, to try to help him.</p>\n<p>Ahead, again Zelda helps Link enter the castle by revealing a hidden passage that was in the corner gardens, going there, Link finds his uncle lying on the floor, he asks him to help Zelda to free himself from the wizard Agahnim. Zelda and Link then meet and go to a secret room, arriving there with a priest who tells Link that to end the chaos created by Agahnim, Link needs to recover the Master Sword that is hidden in Lost Woods.</p>\n<p>After going through one of the most difficult adventures of all Zelda games, Link and Zelda defeat Ganon, who planned to escape the Dark World, manipulating the wizard Agahnim to release him from his seal, Ganon is sealed again, along with the Dark world. After the events of Link to the Past, for some reason Link is absent from Hyrule, and Ganon manages to break free from the Dark World, it is not explained very well how. A new hero, who is not Link appears, is the “Hero of the Light” in which he can be chosen as a man or woman at the beginning of the game.</p>\n<p>The story takes place in 4 weeks, in the first week the hero wakes up in one of the houses of A Link to the Past and is given the task of rescuing Princess Zelda. Over the course of the four weeks, the hero learns more about Ganon and Link and how he should stop Ganon. In the fourth week the hero defeats Ganon, places the Master Sword where it belongs and is teleported back to where it belongs. Many years later, a new Link appears and has the mission to stop Ganon’s actions again, these are the events that took place in the first Legend of Zelda, which as Miyamoto himself said, A Link to the Past are the ancestors of Link and Zelda of the first Legend of Zelda.</p>\n<p>After gathering the 8 pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom and defeating Ganon, the Adventure of Link events begin, where he is summoned for another mission by Impa. It reveals to Link that many generations ago, there was a kingdom where a king reigned with justice and wisdom using the power of the Triforce. This king hid a part of the Triforce, the Triforce of Courage, and reported the secret location only to his daughter Zelda.</p>\n<p>When the king passed away, his son wanted to know the location of the Triforce, but his sister Zelda did not want to reveal it, so he sent a witch to use a spell to force his sister to reveal the location of the Triforce, and was unsuccessful. Then the witch cast a spell on Princess Zelda that put her to sleep. Terrified by the tragedy, the prince ordered that from that generation, all the princesses of Hyrule should be called Zelda.</p>\n<p>This was a very important event, which is very different from the Wind Waker timeline, in which we have Tetra. Returning to Adventure of Link, after Link restored the Triforce of Courage and woke up Princess Zelda, she is kidnapped by dragons and begins the Game &#x26; Watch Zelda.</p>\n<p>Many disregard this game, but it is an official Nintendo release and should not be disregarded. After providing many services of the Royal Family and saving Hyrule, Triforce summons Link and sends him to a distant kingdom that needs help.</p>\n<p>Then the Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages events begin. When one of the two games is finished and you start the second game with the code given at the end of the first, the true story of the game is revealed. At the end of the game (if you started with the code after finishing the other one) it is revealed that Zelda had been captured by Ganondorf’s mothers due to trying to resuscitate Ganon.</p>\n<p>At the end of the game Link defeats Ganon and goes out on a raft back to his homeland, Hyrule. But a storm causes him to get lost, and ends up stopping on Koholint Island. Link learns that to leave this island, he first needs to wake up Wind Fish, and upon waking him up, Link discovers that the island he was on was just a creation of a Wind Fish dream, the game is over and it is not clear whether Link made it home or not.</p>\n<p>After Link’s Awakening, many years have passed and A Link to the Past events begin. I know it’s almost official that Link’s Awakening is a sequel to A Link to the Past, but there were also a lot of mistakes in translating from Japanese to English, but it wouldn’t be possible to put Link to the Past as the protagonist of Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons for the simple fact that in Oracle of Age / Seasons you eliminate Ganon, and following A Link to The Past, where Link is not the hero but “The Hero of Light”, Ganon is also defeated , making this connection impossible, as there would be two Ganons at the same time in different lands.</p>\n<p>Yeah, quite a lot! I guarantee you that this placement there, even before the Skyward Sword announcement was the one that made the most sense, despite some small inconsistencies, but that could be fixed with perhaps some other game between the stories.</p>\n<p>I will do the timeline again, we just need to know a little more about the Skyward Sword story. Until then, we only have … I don’t know, keep thinking until the brain burns !!!</p>","fields":{"postHashId":"Z2FtZXN0cnVlLi4vLi4vY292ZXJzLzIwMTAvcG9zdC1pZC0yMTc0LWNvdmVyLnBuZzIwMTAtMDctMDNUMDA6MDA6MDAuMDAwWg==","slug":"/2010/2010-07-03-zelda-timeline-and-skyward-sword-placement.en/","path":"/blog/games/zelda-timeline-and-skyward-sword-placement/","locale":"en"},"readingTime":{"minutes":13.77},"frontmatter":{"path":"zelda-timeline-and-skyward-sword-placement","allowComments":true,"title":"Zelda timeline and Skyward Sword placement","date":"2010-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","categories":["games"],"tags":["skyward sword","timeline","zelda","games","general"],"hideExcerpt":false,"subtitle":""}},"categoryImage":{"childImageSharp":{"original":{"width":1920,"height":1080,"src":"/static/categories_games-45dce0594b4828053338793f21283cda.jpg"}}}},"pageContext":{"postHashId":"Z2FtZXN0cnVlLi4vLi4vY292ZXJzLzIwMTAvcG9zdC1pZC0yMTc0LWNvdmVyLnBuZzIwMTAtMDctMDNUMDA6MDA6MDAuMDAwWg==","relatedPosts":[{"fields":{"postHashId":"Z2FtZXN0cnVlbnVsbDIwMjEtMDctMTRUMDA6MDA6MDAuMDAwWg==","slug":"/2021/2021-07-14-creating-my-dream-skyward-sword-hd-switch-accessories.en/","path":"/blog/games/creating-my-dream-skyward-sword-hd-switch-accessories/","locale":"en"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["general","zelda","games","accessories","skyward sword","nintendo switch","thingiverse","fiverr","3d"],"categories":["games"],"allowComments":true,"publishOnMedium":null,"cover":null,"date":"2021-07-14T00:00:00.000Z","id":null,"path":"creating-my-dream-skyward-sword-hd-switch-accessories","show":true,"title":"Creating my dream Skyward Sword HD Switch accessories","hideExcerpt":null,"subtitle":null}},{"fields":{"postHashId":"Z2FtZXN0cnVlLi4vLi4vY292ZXJzLzIwMTAvcG9zdC1pZC0xODI2LWNvdmVyLnBuZzIwMTAtMDItMThUMDA6MDA6MDAuMDAwWg==","slug":"/2010/2010-02-18-camy-hero-pack-for-those-who-cannot-wait-for-the-new-zelda.en/","path":"/blog/games/camy-hero-pack-for-those-who-cannot-wait-for-the-new-zelda/","locale":"en"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["general","zelda","games","accessories","skyward sword","wii"],"categories":["games"],"allowComments":true,"publishOnMedium":false,"cover":"../../covers/2010/post-id-1826-cover.png","date":"2010-02-18T00:00:00.000Z","id":1826,"path":"camy-hero-pack-for-those-who-cannot-wait-for-the-new-zelda","show":true,"title":"Camy Hero Pack - For those who cannot wait for the next Zelda","hideExcerpt":false,"subtitle":""}},{"fields":{"postHashId":"Z2FtZXN0cnVlLi4vLi4vY292ZXJzLzIwMDkvcG9zdC1pZC0xMzI5LWNvdmVyLnBuZzIwMDktMDktMTVUMDA6MDA6MDAuMDAwWg==","slug":"/2009/2009-09-15-zelda-timeline.en/","path":"/blog/games/zelda-timeline/","locale":"en"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["zelda","games","timeline","theories"],"categories":["games"],"allowComments":true,"publishOnMedium":false,"cover":"../../covers/2009/post-id-1329-cover.png","date":"2009-09-15T00:00:00.000Z","id":1329,"path":"zelda-timeline","show":true,"title":"Zelda timeline?","hideExcerpt":false,"subtitle":""}},{"fields":{"postHashId":"ZXZlbnRzdHJ1ZS4uLy4uL2NvdmVycy8yMDE0L3Bvc3QtaWQtMjI2Ni1jb3Zlci5wbmcyMDE0LTA4LTA4VDAwOjAwOjAwLjAwMFo=","slug":"/2014/2014-08-08-trip-to-la-e3-2014.en/","path":"/blog/events/trip-to-la-e3-2014/","locale":"en"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["general","games","trips","e3","events"],"categories":["events"],"allowComments":true,"publishOnMedium":false,"cover":"../../covers/2014/post-id-2266-cover.png","date":"2014-08-08T00:00:00.000Z","id":2266,"path":"trip-to-la-e3-2014","show":true,"title":"Trip to LA - E3 2014","hideExcerpt":false,"subtitle":""}},{"fields":{"postHashId":"ZXZlbnRzdHJ1ZS4uLy4uL2NvdmVycy8yMDEyL3Bvc3QtaWQtMjIzMy1jb3Zlci5wbmcyMDEyLTEyLTIwVDAwOjAwOjAwLjAwMFo=","slug":"/2012/2012-12-20-trip-to-e3-2012.en/","path":"/blog/events/trip-to-e3-2012/","locale":"en"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["general","games","trips","e3","events"],"categories":["events"],"allowComments":true,"publishOnMedium":false,"cover":"../../covers/2012/post-id-2233-cover.png","date":"2012-12-20T00:00:00.000Z","id":2233,"path":"trip-to-e3-2012","show":true,"title":"Trip to E3 2012","hideExcerpt":false,"subtitle":""}},{"fields":{"postHashId":"ZXZlbnRzdHJ1ZS4uLy4uL2NvdmVycy8yMDEyL3Bvc3QtaWQtMjIyMS1jb3Zlci5wbmcyMDEyLTA1LTMxVDAwOjAwOjAwLjAwMFo=","slug":"/2012/2012-05-31-e3-2012-and-here-we-go.en/","path":"/blog/events/e3-2012-and-here-we-go/","locale":"en"},"frontmatter":{"tags":["general","trips","e3","los angeles","games"],"categories":["events"],"allowComments":true,"publishOnMedium":false,"cover":"../../covers/2012/post-id-2221-cover.png","date":"2012-05-31T00:00:00.000Z","id":2221,"path":"e3-2012-and-here-we-go","show":true,"title":"E3 2012 - And here we...

One weird thing about Spirit Tracks is the Lokomo Sword, which was designed by the Gods to humans to defeat the bad in the past. She has an incredible resemblance to the Master Sword. Would it be itself with a different name, or does each land have its own weapon to fight evil?</p>\n<p>This remains open, everyone thinks what they want. Now, after Spirit Tracks, not much is known, so I’m going to fit a game that starts in a game that doesn’t know much about the past: Minish Cap. But between Minish Cap and Spirit Tracks I would like to put the future Zelda for Wii.</p>\n<p>Not that much is already known about the game, but what everything indicates is that it will be a game that will show a lot about Master Sword, and perhaps explain the Master Sword / Picori Sword transition. In Minish Cap, a new villain appears: Vaati.</p>\n<p>A sorcerer who only wants to become more powerful, and for that he needs the “Light Power” (triforce of wisdom?) That Princess Zelda has. Link once again has the mission to save Princess Zelda and on the way to his adventure, he forges the Four Sword and defeats Vaati.</p>\n<p>Since this Zelda doesn’t comment on Triforce or Ganon, the only thing we can imagine is that it is hundreds of years after Spirit Tracks, but one thing is certain: Minish have always existed. In a quote from the game, it says that the Minish have fun hiding items and breaks under rocks and grass around the world. After Minish Cap, obviously comes the Game Boy Advance’s Four Swords, in which Vaati manages to escape his prison and kidnaps Princess Zelda. Link goes after it to rescue Zelda and reseals Vaati on the Four Sword.</p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter comes the Four Swords Adventures, for Game Cube, in which Vaati is released again and at the end of the game it is revealed that Vaati was just being manipulated by Ganon, Link defeats Vaati and Ganon and saddles Ganon on the Four Sword. Here ends the timeline of the adult link for Ocarina of Time. Now let’s go back to the beginning of everything: Ocarina of Time’s Link goes back in time and tells Princess Zelda everything about Ganondorf and his plans and Ganondorf is sentenced to death.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Link says goodbye to Zelda as he goes in search of his companion Navi, who left him at the end of Ocarina of Time. While looking for Navi, Link gets lost in Lost Woods and is approached by a Skull Kid, who steals his Ocarina of Time and Epona, while following him, Link is teleported to another world, a universe parallel to Hyrule. Once there, Link learns that the moon is about to fall, and Link has only three days to stop the moon.</p>\n<p>At the end of the third day, Link uses the Ocarina of Time to go back in time and continue his adventure. At the end of the game, it is not very clear whether or not Link returns to Hyrule, but there are theories that he appears in the Twilight Princess in the form of Stalfo, I will talk about this later.</p>\n<p>Returning to the timeline, a while passed by Ocarina of Time and a tribe of dark magicians known as Dark Interlopers tried to get the Triforce using the power of the Fused Shadow but were stopped by the Light Spirits. Again, I don’t know if there will be a Zelda based on this story, so I’ll leave a question here. Hundreds of years later, the events of Twilight Princess take place, in which Ganondorf tries to dominate Hyrule again, but this time manipulating Zant, a being of the Twilight Realm, which I also believe to be the Dark World, as well as many.</p>\n<p>After defeating Zant, Link battles Ganondorf and defeats him with the Master Sword. After the events of Twilight Princess, many hundreds of years pass, and for some reason, Triforce is separated into several pieces. After the events of Twilight Princess, the A Link to The Past begins, in which the Imprisoning War is introduced, which is not known for sure if the events occurred in Twilight Princess or Ocarina of Time. Link to the Past begins on a night when Link wakes up to the telepathic cry for help made by Zelda, who tries to call someone to her rescue, upon hearing the words Link’s Uncle takes his shield and sword and goes after it to rescue the Princess. Link gets up from his bed and goes after his uncle, to try to help him.</p>\n<p>Ahead, again Zelda helps Link enter the castle by revealing a hidden passage that was in the corner gardens, going there, Link finds his uncle lying on the floor, he asks him to help Zelda to free himself from the wizard Agahnim. Zelda and Link then meet and go to a secret room, arriving there with a priest who tells Link that to end the chaos created by Agahnim, Link needs to recover the Master Sword that is hidden in Lost Woods.</p>\n<p>After going through one of the most difficult adventures of all Zelda games, Link and Zelda defeat Ganon, who planned to escape the Dark World, manipulating the wizard Agahnim to release him from his seal, Ganon is sealed again, along with the Dark world. After the events of Link to the Past, for some reason Link is absent from Hyrule, and Ganon manages to break free from the Dark World, it is not explained very well how. A new hero, who is not Link appears, is the “Hero of the Light” in which he can be chosen as a man or woman at the beginning of the game.</p>\n<p>The story takes place in 4 weeks, in the first week the hero wakes up in one of the houses of A Link to the Past and is given the task of rescuing Princess Zelda. Over the course of the four weeks, the hero learns more about Ganon and Link and how he should stop Ganon. In the fourth week the hero defeats Ganon, places the Master Sword where it belongs and is teleported back to where it belongs. Many years later, a new Link appears and has the mission to stop Ganon’s actions again, these are the events that took place in the first Legend of Zelda, which as Miyamoto himself said, A Link to the Past are the ancestors of Link and Zelda of the first Legend of Zelda.</p>\n<p>After gathering the 8 pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom and defeating Ganon, the Adventure of Link events begin, where he is summoned for another mission by Impa. It reveals to Link that many generations ago, there was a kingdom where a king reigned with justice and wisdom using the power of the Triforce. This king hid a part of the Triforce, the Triforce of Courage, and reported the secret location only to his daughter Zelda.</p>\n<p>When the king passed away, his son wanted to know the location of the Triforce, but his sister Zelda did not want to reveal it, so he sent a witch to use a spell to force his sister to reveal the location of the Triforce, and was unsuccessful. Then the witch cast a spell on Princess Zelda that put her to sleep. Terrified by the tragedy, the prince ordered that from that generation, all the princesses of Hyrule should be called Zelda.</p>\n<p>This was a very important event, which is very different from the Wind Waker timeline, in which we have Tetra. Returning to Adventure of Link, after Link restored the Triforce of Courage and woke up Princess Zelda, she is kidnapped by dragons and begins the Game &amp; Watch Zelda.</p>\n<p>Many disregard this game, but it is an official Nintendo release and should not be disregarded. After providing many services of the Royal Family and saving Hyrule, Triforce summons Link and sends him to a distant kingdom that needs help.</p>\n<p>Then the Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages events begin. When one of the two games is finished and you start the second game with the code given at the end of the first, the true story of the game is revealed. At the end of the game (if you started with the code after finishing the other one) it is revealed that Zelda had been captured by Ganondorf’s mothers due to trying to resuscitate Ganon.</p>\n<p>At the end of the game Link defeats Ganon and goes out on a raft back to his homeland, Hyrule. But a storm causes him to get lost, and ends up stopping on Koholint Island. Link learns that to leave this island, he first needs to wake up Wind Fish, and upon waking him up, Link discovers that the island he was on was just a creation of a Wind Fish dream, the game is over and it is not clear whether Link made it home or not.</p>\n<p>After Link’s Awakening, many years have passed and A Link to the Past events begin. I know it’s almost official that Link’s Awakening is a sequel to A Link to the Past, but there were also a lot of mistakes in translating from Japanese to English, but it wouldn’t be possible to put Link to the Past as the protagonist of Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons for the simple fact that in Oracle of Age / Seasons you eliminate Ganon, and following A Link to The Past, where Link is not the hero but “The Hero of Light”, Ganon is also defeated , making this connection impossible, as there would be two Ganons at the same time in different lands.</p>\n<p>Yeah, quite a lot! I guarantee you that this placement there, even before the Skyward Sword announcement was the one that made the most sense, despite some small inconsistencies, but that could be fixed with perhaps some other game between the stories.</p>\n<p>I will do the timeline again, we just need to know a little more about the Skyward Sword story. Until then, we only have … I don’t know, keep thinking until the brain burns !!!</p>","otherLanguagesUrl":["/pt-br/blog/games/linha-do-tempo-de-zelda-e-skyward-sword/"],"rss":{"title":"Zelda timeline and Skyward Sword placement","description":"Zelda timeline and Skyward Sword placement","date":"2010-07-03T00:00:00.000Z"},"images":["/static/zelda-timeline-and-skyward-sword-placement-c124be40f7e39c8da1a28c44dd1696b9.png"],"videos":[],"comments":[],"googleFormData":{"fvv":1,"pageHistory":0,"fbzx":"5566947645549549202","action":"e/1FAIpQLSeST_0jBnLKkEkXGpyx9LWrvV2a1-1F5dr-AcA4wn0BSRyPCw","title":"blog_comment","description":null,"fields":[{"label":"name","description":null,"type":"SHORT_ANSWER","id":"1953327618","required":true},{"label":"email","description":null,"type":"SHORT_ANSWER","id":"1309141965","required":false},{"label":"twitter","description":null,"type":"SHORT_ANSWER","id":"740186305","required":false},{"label":"comment","description":null,"type":"LONG_ANSWER","id":"1663940054","required":true},{"label":"post_path","description":null,"type":"SHORT_ANSWER","id":"1852628638","required":true}],"fieldsOrder":{"740186305":2,"1309141965":1,"1663940054":3,"1852628638":4,"1953327618":0}},"pageType":"blogPost","categoryImage":"/categories_games.jpg/","slug":"/2010/2010-07-03-zelda-timeline-and-skyward-sword-placement.en/","locale":"en","title":"Zelda timeline and Skyward Sword placement","previous":{"excerpt":"Percebi que não existem muitos vídeos sobre isso, então fiz…","html":"<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 540px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"talento\"\n        title=\"Talento\"\n        src=\"/static/187326c34432ce1bb2b827995183a387/ceaae/talento.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/187326c34432ce1bb2b827995183a387/db830/talento.jpg 256w,\n/static/187326c34432ce1bb2b827995183a387/8102f/talento.jpg 512w,\n/static/187326c34432ce1bb2b827995183a387/ceaae/talento.jpg 540w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span>\n    <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\">Talento</figcaption>\n  </figure></p>\n<p>Percebi que não existem muitos vídeos sobre isso, então fiz a minha contribuição!

Bem como o Miyamoto uma vez disse “Ocarina of Time is the very first story!“. Acontece que recentemente descobrimos que não é bem assim: Durante a E3 desse ano foi revelado o Skyward Sword, novo jogo da série Zelda para Wii.</p>\n<p>O que acontece é que nesse jogo é revelado como a Master Sword se torna Master Sword, e vendo que a Master Sword já existia no Ocarina of Time, óbviamente Skyward Sword vem de todos os Zeldas. O que fez tudo ficar beeem problemático, pois eu passei horas e horas colocando a timeline junta, e muitas vezes algumas história faziam todo o sentido de ficar antes do Ocarina of Time, mas não podia pelo simples fato de Ocarina of Time ser o primeiro Zelda, bom, não mais.</p>\n<p>Pelo menos o Skyward Sword chegou já explicando MUITO, mesmo com tão pouco revelado. O fato da Skyward Sword poder virar a Master Sword explica perfeitamente porque a Picori Sword e a Lokomo Sword se parecem tanto com a Master Sword – De alguma forma a Master Sword acaba virando a Picori/Lokomo Sword.</p>\n<p>Como pouquissímos detalhes foram revelados sobre o Skyward Sword, eu prefiro não pensar mais na timeline por enquanto, mesmo porque apesar de explicar algumas coisas, o Skyward Sword trouxe muito mais dúvidas do que clarezas.</p>\n<p>Então estou liberando abaixo o post que eu pretendia fazer sobre a timeline de Zelda. Preparem-se para uma gigantesca <a href=\"http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Wall_of_Text\" title=\"Wall of Text\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">WOT</a> !</p>\n<p>Depois de pesquisar MUITO, eu completei a minha visão sobre a timeline de Zelda. Eu sei que muitos já fizeram o mesmo, inclusive o site GameTrailer, mas a cada jogo lançado, brexas nessas teorias são criadas.</p>\n<p>Vou mostra-los a minha própria teoria sobre a timeline de Zelda, de todos os Zeldas que eu joguei e de tudo que eu estudei sobre, eu fico satisfeito com essa sendo a timeline “oficial” para mim. Antes de tudo, uma coisa que precisamos entender é que Hyrule não o nome de um mundo, como o nosso é Terra.</p>\n<p>É apenas um continente de um mundo que ainda não foi revelado, assim como Labrynna e Holodrum do Oracle of Ages e Oracle of Seasons são continentes da mesma maneira. Outra coisa importante é saber que o nome héroi do jogo, não é necessáriamente Link, tanto que você pode escolher o nome a cada começo de jogo.</p>\n<p>Certo então, a primeira coisa que sabemos sobre o universo de Zelda, é a criação de Hyrule pelas três Deusas, Din, Nayru e Farore (No ato de criação do mundo de Hyrule, multiplos universos foram criados).</p>\n<p>Então houve a grande guerra em Hyrule, conhecida como Hyrulean Civil War para ver quem ficava com o poder da Triforce, a guerra teve seu fim com a Triforce nas mãos da Familia Real de Hyrule, assim começando os eventos de Ocarina of Time.</p>\n<p>Apesar do anuncio precipitado de Aonuma sobre Four Swords para GBA, no qual ele afirma sobre esse jogo ser o primeiro na timeline de Zelda, eu me baseio mais nas citações no qual ele realmente fazia parte do desenvolvimento da história do jogo, não como produtor, como ele foi em Four Swords. Depois dos eventos em Ocarina of Time, temos a famosa timeline dividida, no qual uma delas o Link volta no tempo e conta para Princesa Zelda tudo sobre o Ganondorf e seus planos, e no outro ele continua no futuro devastado pelo poder de Ganondorf.</p>\n<p>Vamos agora continuar com a timeline no qual Link permanesse adulto. Depois do mundo ter sido destruido pelo Ganondorf, ocorrem os eventos citados na backstory de Wind Waker: O rei e o povo de Hyrule pediram aos Deuses para inundar o mundo, com medo do poder maléfico de Ganon, que de algum jeito ressuscitou e por algum motivo não foi impedido pelo Link.</p>\n<p>Não sei essa história virá a ser algum jogo de Zelda, mas vou deixar uma interrogação nesse ponto. Centenas de anos se passaram e um novo Link nasce, ele recebe uma roupa de sua vó em seu aniversário, como ritual da espera da volta do Héroi do passado. Esses são os acontecimentos de Wind Waker. Esse Link se encontra com uma pirata chamada Tetra que depois se revela ser a reencarnação da princesa de Hyrule, Zelda e o King of Red Lions revela-se ser o antigo rei que inundou Hyrule, Daphnes Nohansen Hyrule.</p>\n<p>Após juntar os pedaços da Triforce da Coragem e matar Ganondorf, Zelda e Link recebem a missão de buscar uma nova terra para governar. Link e Tetra vão em busca de terras novas, e se deparam com um navio fantasma, acarretando os eventos de Phantom Hourglass, onde Link acorda em uma terra desconhecida e Tetra está sumida. Determinado a encontrar Tetra, Link vai em mais uma aventura, onde no final é revelado que Link não estava em seu mundo, e sim no Mundo do Ocean King.</p>\n<p>Ao voltar para seu próprio mundo, os marinheiros do navio de Tetra afirmam que os dois ficaram desacordados no navio fanstasma por apenas 10 minutos, então Link olha em seu bolso e encontra a Phantom Hourglass. Uma aventura em um universo paralelo ou apenas um sonho?</p>\n<p>Na verdade não importa, pois logo em seguida vem os eventos de Spirit Tracks. Muitas citações no próprio jogo mostram que esse novo reino foi encontrado pelos anceistrais de Link e Zelda, que o batizaram de Hyrule, em virtude ao antigo reino esquecido pelas pessoas. Uma coisa esquisita em Spirit Tracks é a Lokomo Sword, esparada que foi concebida pelos Deuses aos humanos para derrotar o mau no passado. Ela tem uma incrível semelhança com a Master Sword. Ela seria a própria com um nome diferente ou cada terra possui sua própria arma para combater o mau?</p>\n<p>Isso fica por aberto, cada um pensa o que quiser. Agora, depois de Spirit Tracks não se sabe muito, então eu vou encaixar um jogo que começa em um jogo que não se sabe muito do passado: Minish Cap. Mas entre Minish Cap e Spirit Tracks eu gostaria de colocar o futuro Zelda para Wii.</p>\n<p>Não que já se saiba bastante sobre o jogo, mas o que tudo indica é que será um jogo que mostrará muito sobre a Master Sword, e talvez explique a transição Master Sword/Picori Sword. No Minish Cap, surge um novo vilão: Vaati.</p>\n<p>Um feiticeiro que a única coisa que deseja é se tornar mais poderoso, e para isso ele precisa da “Light Power” (triforce da sabedoria?) que a princessa Zelda possui. Link mais uma vez tem a missão de salvar a princessa Zelda e no caminho de sua aventura, ele forja a Four Sword e derrota Vaati.</p>\n<p>Como esse Zelda não comenta nada sobre a Triforce ou Ganon, a única coisa que podemos imaginar é que se passa centenas de anos depois de Spirit Tracks, mas uma coisa é certa: Os Minish sempre existiram. Em uma citação do jogo, diz que os Minish se divertem escondendo itens e ruppes debaixo de pedras e nas gramas pelo mundo. Depois de Minish Cap, óbviamente vem o Four Swords de Game Boy Advance, no qual Vaati consegue escapar de sua prisão e rapta a princessa Zelda. Link vai atras para resgatar Zelda e sela novamente Vaati na Four Sword.</p>\n<p>Logo depois vem o Four Swords Adventures, para Game Cube, no qual Vaati é libertado novamente e no final do jogo é revelado que Vaati estava apenas sendo manipulado por Ganon, Link vence Vaati e Ganon e sela Ganon na Four Sword. Aqui termina a timeline do Link adulto de Ocarina of Time. Agora vamos voltar para o inicio de tudo: O Link de Ocarina of Time volta no tempo e conta para Princesa Zelda tudo sobre o Ganondorf e seus planos e Ganondorf é sentenciado a morte.</p>\n<p>Enquanto isso, Link se despede de Zelda, pois vai em busca de sua companheira Navi, que o deixou no final de Ocarina of Time. Enquanto está a procura de Navi, Link se perde em Lost Woods e é abordado por um Skull Kid, que rouba sua Ocarina of Time e a Epona, ao segui-lo, Link é teletransportado para outro mundo, um universo paralelo a Hyrule. Chegando lá, Link fica sabendo que a lua está prestes a cair, e Link tem apenas três dias para deter a lua.</p>\n<p>No final do terceiro dia, Link utiliza a Ocarina of Time para voltar no tempo e assim continuar sua aventura. No final do jogo, não fica muito claro se o Link volta ou não para Hyrule, mas existem teorias de que ele aparece no Twilight Princess em forma de Stalfo, eu falarei sobre isso mais tarde.</p>\n<p>Voltando a timeline, um tempo se passou do Ocarina of Time e uma tribo de magos das trevas conhecidos como Dark Interlopers tentaram conseguir a Triforce utilizando o poder da Fused Shadow mas foram detidos pelos Light Spirits. Novamente não sei se haverá um Zelda baseado nessa história, então vou deixar uma interrogação aqui. Centenas de anos depois, acontecem os eventos de Twilight Princess, no qual Ganondorf tenta dominar Hyrule novamente, mas dessa vez manipulando Zant, um ser do Twilight Realm, que eu também acredito ser o Dark World, assim como muitos.</p>\n<p>Após derrotar Zant, Link batalha com Ganondorf e o derrota com a Master Sword. Após os eventos de Twilight Princess, muitas centenas de anos se passam, e por algum motivos, a Triforce é separada em vários pedaços. Após os acontecimentos de Twilight Princess, começam os the A Link to The Past, no qual é introduzida a Imprisoning War, que não se sabe ao certo se são os eventos ocorrido em Twilight Princess ou Ocarina of Time. A Link to the Past começa em uma noite em que Link acorda com o pedido de socorro feito telepaticamente pela Zelda, que tenta chamar alguém a seu socorro, ao escutar as palavras o Tio de Link pega seu escudo e espada e vai atrás para resgatar a princesa. Link levanta de sua cama e vai atrás de seu tio, para tentar ajudá-lo.</p>\n<p>Mais a frente, novamente Zelda ajuda a Link entrar no castelo revelando uma passagem oculta que havia nos jardins dos cantos, indo por lá, Link encontra seu tio deitado ao chão, ele pede para que fosse ajudar Zelda a se libertar do mago Agahnim. Zelda e Link então se encontram e vão para uma sala secreta, chegando lá encontram com um padre que conta para Link que para acabar com o caos criado por Agahnim, Link precisa recuperar a Master Sword que se encontra escondida em Lost Woods.</p>\n<p>Depois de passar por uma das aventuras mais difíceis de todos os jogos de Zelda, Link e Zelda derrotam Ganon, que planejava fugir do Dark World, manipulando o mago Agahnim a soltá-lo de seu selo, Ganon é selado novamente, juntamente com o Dark world. Depois dos eventos de Link to the Past, por algum motivo Link se ausenta de Hyrule, e Ganon consegue se libertar do Dark World, não é explicado muito bem como. Um novo herói, que não é o Link aparece, é o “Hero of the Light” no qual pode ser escolhido como homem ou mulher no começo do jogo.</p>\n<p>A história se passa em 4 semanas, na primeira semana o herói acorda em uma das casas de A Link to the Past e lhe é passada a tarefa de resgatar a princesa Zelda. Ao decorrer das quatro semanas, o herói fica sabendo mais sobre Ganon e Link e sobre como ele deve impedir Ganon. Na quarta semana o herói derrota Ganon, coloca a Master Sword onde ela pertence e é teletransportado de volta para onde pertence. Muitos anos depois, um novo Link aparece e tem a missão de novamente parar as ações de Ganon, esses são os eventos passados no primeiro Legend of Zelda, que como o próprio Miyamoto disse, A Link to the Past são os ancestrais do Link e Zelda do primeiro Legend of Zelda.</p>\n<p>Depois de juntar os 8 pedaços da Triforce da Sabedoria e derrotar Ganon, começam os eventos de Adventure of Link, onde ele é convocado pra mais uma missão por Impa. Ela revela para Link que muitas gerações atrás, houve um reino onde um rei reinava com justiça e sabedoria utilizando o poder da Triforce. Esse rei escondeu uma parte da Triforce, a Triforce da Coragem, e informou a secreta localização apenas para sua filha Zelda.</p>\n<p>Quando o rei faleceu, seu filho quis saber a localização da Triforce, mas sua irmã Zelda não quis revelar, então ele mandou uma feiticeira utilizar um feitiço para forçar sua irmã a revelar a localização da Triforce, e não obteve sucesso. Então a feiticeira lançou um feitiço na princessa Zelda que a colocou em sono profundo. Aterrorizado com a tragédia, o principe ordenou que a partir daquela geração, todas as princesas de Hyrule deveriam se chamar Zelda.</p>\n<p>Esse foi um acontecimento importantíssimo, o que diferencia muito da timeline de Wind Waker, no qual temos a Tetra. Voltando a Adventure of Link, após Link ter restaurado a Triforce da Coragem e acordado a princessa Zelda, ela é raptada por dragões e começa o Zelda de Game &#x26; Watch.</p>\n<p>Muitos desconsideram esse jogo, mas é um lançamento oficial da Nintendo e não deve ser desconsiderado. Após prestar muitos serviços da Familia Real e ter salvo Hyrule, a Triforce convoca Link e o envia para um reinado distante que precisa de ajuda.</p>\n<p>Ai começam os eventos de Oracle of Seasons e Oracle of Ages. Quando um dos dois jogos é terminado e você começa o segundo jogo com o código dado no final do primeiro, a verdadeira história do jogo é revelada. No final do jogo (se você começou com o código depois de terminar o outro) é revelado que Zelda havia sido capturada pelas mães de Ganondorf em função de tentar ressuscitar Ganon.</p>\n<p>No final do jogo Link derrota Ganon e sai em uma jangada de volta para sua terra natal, Hyrule.

Bem como o Miyamoto uma vez disse \"Ocarina of Time is the very first story!\". Acontece que recentemente descobrimos que não é bem assim: Durante a E3 desse ano foi revelado o Skyward Sword, novo jogo da série Zelda para Wii.\r\n\r\nO que acontece é que nesse jogo é revelado como a Master Sword se torna Master Sword, e vendo que a Master Sword já existia no Ocarina of Time, óbviamente Skyward Sword vem de todos os Zeldas. O que fez tudo ficar beeem problemático, pois eu passei horas e horas colocando a timeline junta, e muitas vezes algumas história faziam todo o sentido de ficar antes do Ocarina of Time, mas não podia pelo simples fato de Ocarina of Time ser o primeiro Zelda, bom, não mais.\r\n\r\nPelo menos o Skyward Sword chegou já explicando MUITO, mesmo com tão pouco revelado. O fato da Skyward Sword poder virar a Master Sword explica perfeitamente porque a Picori Sword e a Lokomo Sword se parecem tanto com a Master Sword – De alguma forma a Master Sword acaba virando a Picori/Lokomo Sword.\r\n\r\nComo pouquissímos detalhes foram revelados sobre o Skyward Sword, eu prefiro não pensar mais na timeline por enquanto, mesmo porque apesar de explicar algumas coisas, o Skyward Sword trouxe muito mais dúvidas do que clarezas.\r\n\r\nEntão estou liberando abaixo o post que eu pretendia fazer sobre a timeline de Zelda. Preparem-se para uma gigantesca [WOT](http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Wall_of_Text \"Wall of Text\") !\r\n\r\nDepois de pesquisar MUITO, eu completei a minha visão sobre a timeline de Zelda. Eu sei que muitos já fizeram o mesmo, inclusive o site GameTrailer, mas a cada jogo lançado, brexas nessas teorias são criadas.\r\n\r\nVou mostra-los a minha própria teoria sobre a timeline de Zelda, de todos os Zeldas que eu joguei e de tudo que eu estudei sobre, eu fico satisfeito com essa sendo a timeline \"oficial\" para mim. Antes de tudo, uma coisa que precisamos entender é que Hyrule não o nome de um mundo, como o nosso é Terra.\r\n\r\nÉ apenas um continente de um mundo que ainda não foi revelado, assim como Labrynna e Holodrum do Oracle of Ages e Oracle of Seasons são continentes da mesma maneira. Outra coisa importante é saber que o nome héroi do jogo, não é necessáriamente Link, tanto que você pode escolher o nome a cada começo de jogo.\r\n\r\nCerto então, a primeira coisa que sabemos sobre o universo de Zelda, é a criação de Hyrule pelas três Deusas, Din, Nayru e Farore (No ato de criação do mundo de Hyrule, multiplos universos foram criados).\r\n\r\nEntão houve a grande guerra em Hyrule, conhecida como Hyrulean Civil War para ver quem ficava com o poder da Triforce, a guerra teve seu fim com a Triforce nas mãos da Familia Real de Hyrule, assim começando os eventos de Ocarina of Time.\r\n\r\nApesar do anuncio precipitado de Aonuma sobre Four Swords para GBA, no qual ele afirma sobre esse jogo ser o primeiro na timeline de Zelda, eu me baseio mais nas citações no qual ele realmente fazia parte do desenvolvimento da história do jogo, não como produtor, como ele foi em Four Swords. Depois dos eventos em Ocarina of Time, temos a famosa timeline dividida, no qual uma delas o Link volta no tempo e conta para Princesa Zelda tudo sobre o Ganondorf e seus planos, e no outro ele continua no futuro devastado pelo poder de Ganondorf.\r\n\r\nVamos agora continuar com a timeline no qual Link permanesse adulto. Depois do mundo ter sido destruido pelo Ganondorf, ocorrem os eventos citados na backstory de Wind Waker: O rei e o povo de Hyrule pediram aos Deuses para inundar o mundo, com medo do poder maléfico de Ganon, que de algum jeito ressuscitou e por algum motivo não foi impedido pelo Link.\r\n\r\nNão sei essa história virá a ser algum jogo de Zelda, mas vou deixar uma interrogação nesse ponto. Centenas de anos se passaram e um novo Link nasce, ele recebe uma roupa de sua vó em seu aniversário, como ritual da espera da volta do Héroi do passado. Esses são os acontecimentos de Wind Waker. Esse Link se encontra com uma pirata chamada Tetra que depois se revela ser a reencarnação da princesa de Hyrule, Zelda e o King of Red Lions revela-se ser o antigo rei que inundou Hyrule, Daphnes Nohansen Hyrule.\r\n\r\nApós juntar os pedaços da Triforce da Coragem e matar Ganondorf, Zelda e Link recebem a missão de buscar uma nova terra para governar. Link e Tetra vão em busca de terras novas, e se deparam com um navio fantasma, acarretando os eventos de Phantom Hourglass, onde Link acorda em uma terra desconhecida e Tetra está sumida. Determinado a encontrar Tetra, Link vai em mais uma aventura, onde no final é revelado que Link não estava em seu mundo, e sim no Mundo do Ocean King.\r\n\r\nAo voltar para seu próprio mundo, os marinheiros do navio de Tetra afirmam que os dois ficaram desacordados no navio fanstasma por apenas 10 minutos, então Link olha em seu bolso e encontra a Phantom Hourglass. Uma aventura em um universo paralelo ou apenas um sonho?\r\n\r\nNa verdade não importa, pois logo em seguida vem os eventos de Spirit Tracks. Muitas citações no próprio jogo mostram que esse novo reino foi encontrado pelos anceistrais de Link e Zelda, que o batizaram de Hyrule, em virtude ao antigo reino esquecido pelas pessoas. Uma coisa esquisita em Spirit Tracks é a Lokomo Sword, esparada que foi concebida pelos Deuses aos humanos para derrotar o mau no passado. Ela tem uma incrível semelhança com a Master Sword. Ela seria a própria com um nome diferente ou cada terra possui sua própria arma para combater o mau?\r\n\r\nIsso fica por aberto, cada um pensa o que quiser. Agora, depois de Spirit Tracks não se sabe muito, então eu vou encaixar um jogo que começa em um jogo que não se sabe muito do passado: Minish Cap. Mas entre Minish Cap e Spirit Tracks eu gostaria de colocar o futuro Zelda para Wii.\r\n\r\nNão que já se saiba bastante sobre o jogo, mas o que tudo indica é que será um jogo que mostrará muito sobre a Master Sword, e talvez explique a transição Master Sword/Picori Sword. No Minish Cap, surge um novo vilão: Vaati.\r\n\r\nUm feiticeiro que a única coisa que deseja é se tornar mais poderoso, e para isso ele precisa da \"Light Power\" (triforce da sabedoria?) que a princessa Zelda possui. Link mais uma vez tem a missão de salvar a princessa Zelda e no caminho de sua aventura, ele forja a Four Sword e derrota Vaati.\r\n\r\nComo esse Zelda não comenta nada sobre a Triforce ou Ganon, a única coisa que podemos imaginar é que se passa centenas de anos depois de Spirit Tracks, mas uma coisa é certa: Os Minish sempre existiram. Em uma citação do jogo, diz que os Minish se divertem escondendo itens e ruppes debaixo de pedras e nas gramas pelo mundo. Depois de Minish Cap, óbviamente vem o Four Swords de Game Boy Advance, no qual Vaati consegue escapar de sua prisão e rapta a princessa Zelda. Link vai atras para resgatar Zelda e sela novamente Vaati na Four Sword.\r\n\r\nLogo depois vem o Four Swords Adventures, para Game Cube, no qual Vaati é libertado novamente e no final do jogo é revelado que Vaati estava apenas sendo manipulado por Ganon, Link vence Vaati e Ganon e sela Ganon na Four Sword. Aqui termina a timeline do Link adulto de Ocarina of Time. Agora vamos voltar para o inicio de tudo: O Link de Ocarina of Time volta no tempo e conta para Princesa Zelda tudo sobre o Ganondorf e seus planos e Ganondorf é sentenciado a morte.\r\n\r\nEnquanto isso, Link se despede de Zelda, pois vai em busca de sua companheira Navi, que o deixou no final de Ocarina of Time. Enquanto está a procura de Navi, Link se perde em Lost Woods e é abordado por um Skull Kid, que rouba sua Ocarina of Time e a Epona, ao segui-lo, Link é teletransportado para outro mundo, um universo paralelo a Hyrule. Chegando lá, Link fica sabendo que a lua está prestes a cair, e Link tem apenas três dias para deter a lua.\r\n\r\nNo final do terceiro dia, Link utiliza a Ocarina of Time para voltar no tempo e assim continuar sua aventura. No final do jogo, não fica muito claro se o Link volta ou não para Hyrule, mas existem teorias de que ele aparece no Twilight Princess em forma de Stalfo, eu falarei sobre isso mais tarde.\r\n\r\nVoltando a timeline, um tempo se passou do Ocarina of Time e uma tribo de magos das trevas conhecidos como Dark Interlopers tentaram conseguir a Triforce utilizando o poder da Fused Shadow mas foram detidos pelos Light Spirits. Novamente não sei se haverá um Zelda baseado nessa história, então vou deixar uma interrogação aqui. Centenas de anos depois, acontecem os eventos de Twilight Princess, no qual Ganondorf tenta dominar Hyrule novamente, mas dessa vez manipulando Zant, um ser do Twilight Realm, que eu também acredito ser o Dark World, assim como muitos.\r\n\r\nApós derrotar Zant, Link batalha com Ganondorf e o derrota com a Master Sword. Após os eventos de Twilight Princess, muitas centenas de anos se passam, e por algum motivos, a Triforce é separada em vários pedaços. Após os acontecimentos de Twilight Princess, começam os the A Link to The Past, no qual é introduzida a Imprisoning War, que não se sabe ao certo se são os eventos ocorrido em Twilight Princess ou Ocarina of Time. A Link to the Past começa em uma noite em que Link acorda com o pedido de socorro feito telepaticamente pela Zelda, que tenta chamar alguém a seu socorro, ao escutar as palavras o Tio de Link pega seu escudo e espada e vai atrás para resgatar a princesa. Link levanta de sua cama e vai atrás de seu tio, para tentar ajudá-lo.\r\n\r\nMais a frente, novamente Zelda ajuda a Link entrar no castelo revelando uma passagem oculta que havia nos jardins dos cantos, indo por lá, Link encontra seu tio deitado ao chão, ele pede para que fosse ajudar Zelda a se libertar do mago Agahnim. Zelda e Link então se encontram e vão para uma sala secreta, chegando lá encontram com um padre que conta para Link que para acabar com o caos criado por Agahnim, Link precisa recuperar a Master Sword que se encontra escondida em Lost Woods.\r\n\r\nDepois de passar por uma das aventuras mais difíceis de todos os jogos de Zelda, Link e Zelda derrotam Ganon, que planejava fugir do Dark World, manipulando o mago Agahnim a soltá-lo de seu selo, Ganon é selado novamente, juntamente com o Dark world. Depois dos eventos de Link to the Past, por algum motivo Link se ausenta de Hyrule, e Ganon consegue se libertar do Dark World, não é explicado muito bem como. Um novo herói, que não é o Link aparece, é o \"Hero of the Light\" no qual pode ser escolhido como homem ou mulher no começo do jogo.\r\n\r\nA história se passa em 4 semanas, na primeira semana o herói acorda em uma das casas de A Link to the Past e lhe é passada a tarefa de resgatar a princesa Zelda. Ao decorrer das quatro semanas, o herói fica sabendo mais sobre Ganon e Link e sobre como ele deve impedir Ganon. Na quarta semana o herói derrota Ganon, coloca a Master Sword onde ela pertence e é teletransportado de volta para onde pertence. Muitos anos depois, um novo Link aparece e tem a missão de novamente parar as ações de Ganon, esses são os eventos passados no primeiro Legend of Zelda, que como o próprio Miyamoto disse, A Link to the Past são os ancestrais do Link e Zelda do primeiro Legend of Zelda.\r\n\r\nDepois de juntar os 8 pedaços da Triforce da Sabedoria e derrotar Ganon, começam os eventos de Adventure of Link, onde ele é convocado pra mais uma missão por Impa. Ela revela para Link que muitas gerações atrás, houve um reino onde um rei reinava com justiça e sabedoria utilizando o poder da Triforce. Esse rei escondeu uma parte da Triforce, a Triforce da Coragem, e informou a secreta localização apenas para sua filha Zelda.\r\n\r\nQuando o rei faleceu, seu filho quis saber a localização da Triforce, mas sua irmã Zelda não quis revelar, então ele mandou uma feiticeira utilizar um feitiço para forçar sua irmã a revelar a localização da Triforce, e não obteve sucesso. Então a feiticeira lançou um feitiço na princessa Zelda que a colocou em sono profundo. Aterrorizado com a tragédia, o principe ordenou que a partir daquela geração, todas as princesas de Hyrule deveriam se chamar Zelda.\r\n\r\nEsse foi um acontecimento importantíssimo, o que diferencia muito da timeline de Wind Waker, no qual temos a Tetra. Voltando a Adventure of Link, após Link ter restaurado a Triforce da Coragem e acordado a princessa Zelda, ela é raptada por dragões e começa o Zelda de Game & Watch.\r\n\r\nMuitos desconsideram esse jogo, mas é um lançamento oficial da Nintendo e não deve ser desconsiderado. Após prestar muitos serviços da Familia Real e ter salvo Hyrule, a Triforce convoca Link e o envia para um reinado distante que precisa de ajuda.\r\n\r\nAi começam os eventos de Oracle of Seasons e Oracle of Ages. Quando um dos dois jogos é terminado e você começa o segundo jogo com o código dado no final do primeiro, a verdadeira história do jogo é revelada. No final do jogo (se você começou com o código depois de terminar o outro) é revelado que Zelda havia sido capturada pelas mães de Ganondorf em função de tentar ressuscitar Ganon.\r\n\r\nNo final do jogo Link derrota Ganon e sai em uma jangada de volta para sua terra natal, Hyrule. Mas uma tempestade faz com que ele se perca, e acabe parando na Koholint Island. Link fica sabendo que para deixar essa ilha, ele precisa primeiramente precisa acordar o Wind Fish, e ao acorda-lo, Link descobre que a ilha em que estava era apenas uma criação de um sonho do Wind Fish, o jogo acaba e não fica claro se Link conseguiu voltar para casa ou não.\r\n\r\nDepois de Link's Awakening, muitos anos se passaram e começam os eventos de A Link to the Past. Eu sei que é praticamente oficial que Link's Awakening é sequencia de A Link to the Past, mas também houveram muitos erros na tradução do Japonês para o Inglês, mas não seria possível colocar o Link de Link to the Past sendo o protagonista de Oracle of Ages e Oracle of Seasons pelo simples fato de que em Oracle of Age/Seasons você elimina o Ganon, sendo que na sequência de A Link to The Past, onde Link não é o herói e sim \"The Hero of Light\", Ganon também é derrotado, tornando essa ligação impossível, pois haveriam dois Ganons ao mesmo tempo em diferentes terras.\r\n\r\nÉ, bastante coisa! Eu te garanto que essa colocação ai, até antes do anuncio do Skyward Sword era a que mais fazia sentido, apesar de algumas pequenas incoerências, mas que podiam ser concertadas com talvez algum outro jogo entre as histórias.\r\n\r\nEu farei a timeline novamente, só precisamos saber um pouco mais sobre a história de Skyward Sword. Até lá só nos resta.. não sei, ficar pensando até o cérebro torrar!!!\r\n","frontmatter":{"tags":["skyward sword","linha do tempo","zelda","jogos","geral"],"categories":["games"],"allowComments":true,"publishOnMedium":false,"cover":"../../covers/2010/post-id-2174-cover.png","date":"2010-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","id":2174,"path":"linha-do-tempo-de-zelda-e-skyward-sword","show":true,"title":"Linha do tempo de Zelda e Skyward Sword","hideExcerpt":false,"subtitle":""}},"language":"en","intl":{"language":"en","languages":["en","pt-br"],"messages":{"site_title":"pablo.gg","title":"Title","author":"@thepiratepablo","search_placeholder":"Search...","about":"About","photos":"Photos","archive":"Archive","contact":"Contact","close":"Close","contact_page":"Contact page","see_more":"See more posts","built_with":"Built with ","buy_me_a_soda":"Buy me a soda","blog":"Blog","blog_posts":"Blog posts","go_to_post":"Go to post","search":"Search","loading":"Loading...","search_results":"Search results","search_results_for":"{quantity} search results for: \"{query}\"","search_for_query":"Search for \"{query}\"","no_results":"No results","home":"Home","description":"Yet another developer personal blog","go_back":"Go back to the homepage","thats_me":"That's me!","got_it":"Got it!","check_it_out":"Check it out!","we_are":"We are","e3":"E3","away_from_next_sgf":"away from Summer Game Fest 2025","away_from_next_gamescom":"away from Gamescom 2024","sgf_countdown":"Summer Game Fest Countdown","gamescom_countdown":"Gamescom Countdown","e3_paragraph_1":"This page once featured a countdown to the next E3 event, a moment that countless gamers and industry professionals looked forward to each year.
