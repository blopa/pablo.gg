{"html":"<p>Whatsapp was in all news outlets recently due to its new privacy policies, but this post is not about that. Oh no no, this post is about my 28 hours battle to restore my Whatsapp messages backup that led to nothing, well, kind of.</p>\n<p>Whatsapp isn’t really a good app, I think we all kind of know that? Like really, I need to have my phone connected to the internet to use the web version of it? WTF! But fine, we all use it because it’s the app that everyone uses, right? I mean what can you do? I feel you.</p>\n<p>I’m an early adopter of Whatsapp, back when they had a Symbian version of the app I was using it in my Nokia phone, so I’m using it for many and many years, and I always backup my chat history, first with <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keramidas.TitaniumBackup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Titanium Backup</a> and then with the Google Drive integration, which was convenient because I didn’t have to root my phone and void the warranty.</p>\n<h2 id=\"so-what-happened\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#so-what-happened\" aria-label=\"so what happened permalink\" class=\"post-headers-link before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>So what happened?</h2>\n<p>I got a new phone, a <a href=\"https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_nord_n10_5g-10556.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">OnePlus Nord N10</a>, I know it’s not top-notch but it’s a good upgrade from a <a href=\"https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_moto_z3_play-9003.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Motorola Moto Z3 Play</a> and it has 5G, so I’m happy to help Bill Gates bring the New World Order for us via coronavirus.</p>\n<p>The truth is Whatsapp pisses me off, it’s a super simple yet super buggy and slow messaging app, that I only use to be able to talk to some friends that still don’t use Telegram (noobs). So before moving everything to my new phone, I made a new Whatsapp backup and straight away uninstalled the app from my phone, after all, why would I keep it? I hate it. Silly me…</p>\n<p>I started the process of restoring my Whatsapp backup via Google Drive on my new phone, and then when it hit 24% I got an error: <strong>Couldn’t restore messages</strong>. It’s 10GB of backup data, so I didn’t worry too much and decided to try again, well the thing is that to try again, you need to uninstall Whatsapp and install it again… ok…</p>\n<p>So I did that, and to my surprise, same error, and there is no option to retry or change to restoring from the local storage no no no, if you want to retry, then uninstall and install it again. So I kept trying, different backup sources (local, cloud), different backup files, and then I wasn’t able to ask for an SMS for 2 hours?? lol ok. I waited, tried again, it didn’t work of course, and then I had to wait 7 hours. Awesome.</p>\n<p></p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 576px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 222.265625%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAsABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGQAAAwEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECBAMF/8QAFQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH/2gAMAwEAAhADEAAAAfCqAYhNDzsZIUc2tEB//8QAGxAAAQUBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACESAhEBP/2gAIAQEAAQUCWVDAR5hOEHVJrPf/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAg/9oACAEDAQE/AV//xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAg/9oACAECAQE/AV//xAAXEAADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIDEw/9oACAEBAAY/Ampc/wD/xAAdEAACAQQDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREQIVFhIDGB/9oACAEBAAE/IRYWex+cFltjaLUicmbGXfdZJZJZLP/aAAwDAQACAAMAAAAQe/KDIw//xAAWEQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABESD/2gAIAQMBAT8QGa//xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAg/9oACAECAQE/EF//xAAiEAEAAgEDAwUAAAAAAAAAAAABABExIVFhEIGhQXGx0fH/2gAIAQEAAT8QMVZUpzaMsT4ibyuQmkXoEQpdVEPX7Qb5Sr1gRQB7s/TYqXZeZ9Tv5iN/MNXVicziO9P/2Q=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Now let's wait 24h\" title=\"Now let's wait 24h\" src=\"/static/ac157d47debff09e795b787faedeee4d/17d4d/whatsapp-waiting-time.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/ac157d47debff09e795b787faedeee4d/db830/whatsapp-waiting-time.jpg 256w,\n/static/ac157d47debff09e795b787faedeee4d/8102f/whatsapp-waiting-time.jpg 512w,\n/static/ac157d47debff09e795b787faedeee4d/17d4d/whatsapp-waiting-time.jpg 576w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n    </span>\n    <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\">Now let's wait 24h</figcaption>\n  </figure><p></p>\n<p>Then I started researching, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=whatsapp+restore+stuck+at+24&amp;oq=whatsapp+restore+stuck+at+24%25\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">and many other people have the same problem</a>.
