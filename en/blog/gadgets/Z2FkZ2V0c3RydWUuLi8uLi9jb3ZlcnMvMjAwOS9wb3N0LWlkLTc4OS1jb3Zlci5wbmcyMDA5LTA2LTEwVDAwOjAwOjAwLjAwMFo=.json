But to get the inner works, only with time!</p>\n<p>I spent almost a month playing several hours with <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote</a> a bunch of games that I have on my <a href=\"http://www.nokia.com.br/A4799272\" title=\"Nokia E51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nokia E51</a> and I‚Äôll make a review talking about the pros and cons of <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote</a>. Soon as I grabbed my Zeemote, I had a little problem: Batteries. Well, two AAA batteries are a problem, they‚Äôre expensive and don‚Äôt last long, but with time, I‚Äôve realised that they last a lot with <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote</a>, but is always better to buy rechargeable batteries.</p>\n<p>To synchronize <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote</a> with your cellphone is a really simple process, you have to install <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote‚Äôs</a> software ( <a href=\"http://www.zeemote.com/zeekey/\" title=\"Zeekey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeekey</a> ), which has Portuguese language, and in it you‚Äôll have a simple step-by-step explaining how to connect <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote</a> on your device. After you connect it, let‚Äôs go to the configs: You can create lots of different profiles, each one of them with its own key mapping personalized to the game you want to play. After the key mapping is done, you just have to select the profile you want to use and let <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote</a> running in background: You‚Äôre now free to run any game you want to. When the game started, I got surprised: <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote‚Äôs</a> response is unbelievably fast, without any delay, it‚Äôs just great!</p>\n<p>I spent 20 minutes playing and I admit that at beginning was a little bit difficult to get used to <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote</a>, but as time passed, and after a lot of key re-mapping, I got to the perfect configs. Despite the fast response, bluetooth is not a really fast network, so what happened to me was that <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote‚Äôs</a> response friezed for a second and didn‚Äôt answer my commands, but as I was with my cellphone in the other hand, I kept playing with it, and within a second <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote</a> was good to go again.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately that happened a few times and messes up your game, specially in a crucial part when a lot of commands are sent at the same time, but I believe that this problem can be resolved in the next versions of <a href=\"http://www.zeemote.com/zeekey/\" title=\"Zeekey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeekey</a>. Another problem that I found was because of the games themselves: Companies don‚Äôt create games thinking in <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote</a> (obviously), so some commands, like to move your character diagonally, are not 100% understood by the game itself, which leaves the movement kind of confuse. I don‚Äôt know if you can implement an improvement on <a href=\"http://www.zeemote.com/zeekey/\" title=\"Zeekey\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeekey</a> about this problem, sadly.</p>\n<p>Two AAA batteries last quite a long time on <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote</a>, in this month that I‚Äôve used it I didn‚Äôt have to change them not even once, and I played quite a long time, I carried <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote</a> everywhere. Well, that was kind of a con, I was thinking: To carry <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote</a> from here to there all the time. Who wants to walk with a joystick in their pocket? There you think ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a problem‚Äù.</p>\n<p>I spent the first few days carrying it in my pocket, and then I got used to it and now I can say that it didn‚Äôt bother me at all, actually <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote</a> is now part of my key chain. It‚Äôs light and quite small, practically the size of those first Sony MP3 players. My experience with <a href=\"http://zeemote.com/\" title=\"Official website\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zeemote</a> in the last month was really good and I believe it‚Äôs only going to get better. Well, if you consider yourself addicted in video games, buy a Zeemote.
